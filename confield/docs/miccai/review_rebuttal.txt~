believes this paper is not suited for MICCAI. However, a search of PubMed for
the phrase "resting state fMRI" returns 796 hits with numerous clinical
applications, including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, depression,
schizophrenia, and many others. Therefore, we believe this is an unfair and
incorrect criticism of our paper.

Reviewer 3 also considers our work to be only moderately innovative and
questions the need for the added computational complexity. However, to the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply Markov Random Fields (MRFs) to
the resting state connectivity problem. Previous work using MRFs has all been
for event-related fMRI. The high-dimensional nature of the problem is necessary
if one wants to look at pairwise connectivity. We have shown that a smart
parallel implementation makes this analysis very fast (just a few minutes).

All three reviewers had some concerns about the validation of our method.
However, validation of resting state fMRI is a very difficult problem, due to
the fact that there is no ground truth in real data. Possibly the most
convincing validation arguments given in the literature use a comparison to
connectivity from DTI. This would be beyond the scope of our current paper.
Another possibility is to acquire repeated scans and test the reliability of the
results. Again, this is beyond the scope of the current work. Given these
difficulties, we validated our approach quantitatively on a synthetic example
and qualitatively on real data from two different subjects. The synthetic
example convincingly showed improvement over Gaussian spatial smoothing. Our
result was not only more clustered, as Reviewer 1 points out, but it was also
much more accurate. Reviewer 1 also comments about consistency across subjects.
Our method did demonstrate consistency between the two individual datasets we
tested. Furthermore, our results are consistent with previously reported results
that found connections between posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal
cortex [Greicius 2003, 2009, Fox 2005, etc]. Again, our results were much more
consistent and convincing than the results from Gaussian smoothing, which were
unable to identify this connection.

For Reviewer 2's concerns about extendability to 3D, we have already implemented
and tested the method on a 3D volume since the submission of the paper. The
results are consistent with 2D case, i.e., the connection between PCC and
MFPC. Computation cost is not a problem with the GPU implementation. 3D results
will be presented at MICCAI if the paper is accepted.

In response to Reviewer 2's comment that "Bayesian...was used in previously
published work...": yes, previous methods have used Bayesian estimation in
resting state connectivity, but have not used MRFs. As we mentioned above,
previous work using MRFs is for event-related fMRI.
