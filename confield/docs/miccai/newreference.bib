	abstract = {In {fMRI} studies, Gaussian filtering is usually applied to improve the detection of activated areas. Such lowpass filtering enhances the signal to noise ratio. However, undesirable secondary effects are a bias on the signal shape and a blurring in the spatial domain. Neighboring activated areas may be merged and the high resolution of the {fMRI} data compromised. In the temporal domain, activation and deactivation slopes are also blurred. We propose an alternative to Gaussian filtering by restoring the signal using a spatiotemporal Markov Random Field which preserves the shape of the transitions. We define some interaction between neighboring voxels which allows us to reduce the noise while preserving the signal characteristics. An energy function is defined as the sum of the interaction potentials and is minimized using a simulated annealing algorithm. The shape of the hemodynamic response is preserved leading to a better characterization of its properties. We demonstrate the use of this approach by applying it to simulated data and to data obtained from a typical {fMRI} study.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance images {(fMRI's)} provide high-resolution datasets which allow researchers to obtain accurate delineation and sensitive detection of activation areas involved in cognitive processes. To preserve the resolution of this noninvasive technique, refined methods are required in the analysis of the data. In this paper, the authors first discuss the widely used methods based on a statistical parameter map {(SPM)} analysis exposing the different shortcomings of this approach when considering high-resolution data. First, the often used Gaussian filtering results in a blurring effect and in delocalization of the activated area. Secondly, the {SPM} approach only considers false alarms due to noise but not rejections of activated voxels. The authors propose to embed the {fMRI} analysis problem into a Bayesian framework consisting of two steps: (i) data restoration and (ii) data analysis. They, therefore, propose two Markov random fields {(MRF's)} to solve these two problems. Results on three protocols (visual, motor and word recognition) are shown for two {SPM} approaches and compared with the proposed {MRF-approach.}},

	abstract = {We present a fully Bayesian approach to modeling in functional magnetic resonance imaging {(FMRI),} incorporating spatio-temporal noise modeling and haemodynamic response function {(HRF)} modeling. A fully Bayesian approach allows for the uncertainties in the noise and signal modeling to be incorporated together to provide full posterior distributions of the {HRF} parameters. The noise modeling is achieved via a nonseparable space-time vector autoregressive process. Previous {FMRI} noise models have either been purely temporal, separable or modeling deterministic trends. The specific form of the noise process is determined using model selection techniques. Notably, this results in the need for a spatially nonstationary and temporally stationary spatial component. Within the same full model, we also investigate the variation of the {HRF} in different areas of the activation, and for different experimental stimuli. We propose a novel {HRF} model made up of half-cosines, which allows distinct combinations of parameters to represent characteristics of interest. In addition, to adaptively avoid over-fitting we propose the use of automatic relevance determination priors to force certain parameters in the model to zero with high precision if there is no evidence to support them in the data. We apply the model to three datasets and observe matter-type dependence of the spatial and temporal noise, and a negative correlation between activation height and {HRF} time to main peak (although we suggest that this apparent correlation may be due to a number of different effects).},

	abstract = {Most of functional magnetic resonance imaging {(fMRI)} time series analysis is based on single voxel data evaluation using parametric statistical tests. The result of such an analysis is a statistical parametric map. Voxels with a high significance value in the parametric test are interpreted as activation regions stimulated by the experimental task. However, for the investigation of functional connectivities it would be interesting to get some detailed information about the temporal dynamics of the blood oxygen level-dependent {(BOLD)} signal. For investigating that behavior, a method for {fMRI} data analysis has been developed that is based on Wiener theory of spectral analysis for multivariate time series. Spectral parameters such as coherence measure and phase lead can be estimated. The resulting maps give detailed information on brain regions that belong to a network structure and also show the temporal behavior of the {BOLD} response function. This paper describes the method and presents a visual {fMRI} experiment as an example to demonstrate the results.},
