\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a new method for spatial regularization of functional
connectivity maps based on Markov Random Field (MRF) priors. The high level of
noise in fMRI leads to errors in functional connectivity detection
algorithms. These errors can be mitigated by some form of spatial
regularization, which leverages correlations between neighboring voxels. A
common approach along these lines is to apply a spatial Gaussian smoothing, but
this can lead to small connectivity regions being lost and to blurring of
regions beyond their actual boundaries. Recent work has proposed MRFs as spatial
priors in detection of fMRI activation in task-based paradigms. We propose to
apply MRF priors to the computation of functional connectivity in resting-state
fMRI. Our Markov priors are in the space of pairwise voxel connections, rather
than in the original image space, resulting in a MRF whose dimension is twice
that of the original image. This prior has the intuitive interpretation that a
pair of voxels are more likely to be connected if they are connected to each
others neighbors. The high dimensionality of the MRF estimation problem leads to
computational challenges. We present an efficient, highly parallelized algorithm
on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We validate our approach on a
synthetically generated example as well as real data from a resting state fMRI
study.

\section{Introduction}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a non-invasive measurement
of cerebral blood flow in the brain that can be used to infer regions of neural
activity. Traditional fMRI studies are based on measuring the response to a set
of stimuli, and analysis involves testing the time series at each voxel for
correlations with the experimental protocol. Recently, there has been growing
interest in using resting-state fMRI to infer the connectivity between spatially
distant regions. A standard approach is to use correlation between pairs of time
series as a measurement of their functional connectivity. The high level of
noise present in fMRI can cause errors in pairwise connectivity measurements,
resulting in spurious false connections as well as false negatives.

In both task-based and resting-state fMRI the impact of imaging noise
can be reduced by taking advantage of the spatial correlations between
neighoring voxels in the image. A common approach used for instance in
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)\cite{worsley_analysis_1995} is to
apply a spatial Gaussian filter to smooth the signal prior to
statistical analysis. However, this can lead to overly blurred
results, where effects with small spatial extent can be lost and
detected regions may extend beyond their actual boundaries. An
alternative approach to spatial regularization that has been proposed
for task activation paradigms is to use a Markov Random Field (MRF)
prior\cite{ou_spatial_2005,descombes_spatio-temporal_1998,descombes_fmri_1998,woolrich_fully_2004,descombes_spatio-temporal_1998,cosman_exact_2004}
, which models the conditional dependence of the signals in
neighboring voxels.

In this work we propose to use MRF models in resting-state fMRI in order to
leverage spatial correlations in functional connectivity maps. Unlike previous
MRF-based approaches, which use the neighborhood structure defined by the
original image voxel grid, the neighborhoods in functional connectivity must
take in to account the possibility relationships between spatially distant
voxels. Therefore, we define the neighborhood graph on the set of all voxel
pairs. This results in a Markov structure on a grid with twice the dimension of
the original image data, i.e., the pairwise connectivities for three-dimensional
images results in a six-dimensional MRF. Intuitively, the neighborhood structure
is defined so that two voxels are more likely to be connected if they are
connected to each other's spatial neighbors.

We combine the Markov prior on functional connectivity maps with a likelihood
model of the time series correlations in a posterior estimation problem.
Furthermore, we model the parameters of the MRF and likelihood as unobserved
random variables in a fully Bayesian framework. The full model is solved using
an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the estimation step the posterior
random field is sampled using Gibbs Sampling and estimated using Mean Field
theory.

In the next section we describe our MRF model of functional connectivity maps.
In Section~\ref{sec:algorithm} we give the details of the algorithm to estimate
the functional connectivity probabilities, including implementation details for
the GPU solver. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:results} we demonstrate the
advantages of our approach on a synthetically generated data set as well as on
real resting-state fMRI data.

% In this paper we use Markov Random field in modeling this spatial
% dependency. existing method that use MRF in fMRI study in (Woolrich
% 2005) have a two state study. In the first step use a univariate
% method of SPM to get the response of each voxel, and in the second
% step, build a MRF on the response.

% Our method is different from previous method in that we do not build
% MRF on the voxels. Instead we look at the connectivity between any
% pair of two voxels. Because the connectivity of two voxels depend on
% the connectivity of the voxels' neighbors, we can also get a random
% field with the `connectivity' as the site of the field. We call this
% the connectivity field. The connectivity is a discrete label with
% possible value $0$ and $1$.

% This connectivity field is Gibbs distribution under (??theory). We use
% Gaussian distribution as the emission function to generate the data
% (here is correlation between two voxels/time series). Then given the
% correlation map, compute the posterior probability that two voxels
% have connectivity 1, which again is a Gibbs distribution. The model
% parameters are estimated by mean field theory and
% Expectation-Maximization method. 

% Our method is different with previous
% application of MRF in fMRI\cite{woolrich_mixture_2005} in that they
% assume smoothness on the $t$ statistics and apply MRF as a second
% stage.

% The novel part of this study is by using MRF to model prior
% distribution of connectivity in a Bayesian framework, we combine the
% information from prior knowledge of 'spatial continuity' and those
% from data, without applying spatial smoothing. In addition, other
% modality like fiber tracking of DT-MRI can be integrated into this
% frame work as a prior knowledge.

% Once we have the posterior probability of the connectivity between any
% pair of voxels or regions, we can use this to compute a default
% functional network. (LW: this is going to far, we haven't done that
% yet. should be in in the 'analysis' or 'conclusion' section).

\section{Markov Random Fields for Functional Connectivity}
\label{sec:model}

Our framework for functional connectivity is a Bayesian approach in which we are
trying to estimate the posterior distribution of the connectivity between
voxels, conditional on the fMRI data. Let $\vec x = \{x_{ij}\}$ denote the
functional connectivity map, i.e., a map denoting whether each pair of voxels
$i,j$ is connected, and let $\vec y$ denote the original fMRI data, or some
meausrements derived from the fMRI. In this work we take $\vec y$ to be the map
of correlations between pairs voxel time series. Then the posterior distribution
is proportionally given by
\begin{equation}
P(\vec x \, | \, \vec y) \prop P(\vec x) \cdot P(\vec y \, | \, \vec x).
\end{equation}
In this work we model $P(\vec x)$, the prior on the connectivity map, using a
MRF, and the likelihood $P(\vec y \, | \, \vec x)$ using Gaussian models of the
Fisher transformed correlation values. We now give details for both of these
pieces of the model.

\subsection{Markov Prior}
Conventional image analysis applications of MRFs~\cite{li_markov_2009} define the set of
sites of the random field as the image voxels, with the neighborhood structure
given by a regular lattice. Because we are studying the pairwise connectivity
between voxels, we need to define a MRF in the higher-dimensional space of voxel
location pairs. Thus, if $\Omega \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional
image domain, then the sites for our connectivity MRF form the set $\mathcal{S}
= \Omega \times \Omega$. Let $i, j \in \Omega$ be voxel locations, and let
$\mathcal{N}_i, \mathcal{N}_j$ denote the set of neighbors of voxel $i$ and $j$,
respectively, in the original image lattice. Then the set of neighbors for the
site $(i, j) \in \mathcal{S}$ is given by $\mathcal{N}_{ij} = (\{i\} \times
\mathcal{N}_j) \cup (\mathcal{N}_i \times \{j\})$. In other words, two sites are
neighbors if they share one coordinate and their other coordinates are neighbors
in the original image lattice. This neighborhood structure will give us the
property in the MRF that two voxels $i, j$ in the image are more likely to be
connected if $i$ is connected to $j$'s neighbors or vice-versa. Equipped with
this graph structure, $\mathcal{S}$ is a regular $2d$-dimensional lattice, which
we will refer to as the {\em connectivity graph}.

We next define a multivariate random variable $\vec x = \{ x_{ij} \}$ on the set
$\mathcal{S}$, where each random variable $x_{ij}$ is a binary variable that
denotes the connectivity ($x_{ij} = 1$) or lack of connectivity ($x_{ij} = -1$)
between voxel $i$ and $j$. If $A \subset \mathcal{S}$, let $\vec x_A$ denote the
set of all $x_{ij}$ with $(i,j) \in A$, and let $\vec x_{-ij}$ denote the
collection of all variables in $\vec x$ excluding $x_{ij}$. For $\vec x$ to be a
MRF it must satisfy the Markov property,
\begin{equation*}
  P( x_{ij} \, | \, \vec x_{-ij}) = p(x_{ij} \, | \, x_{\mathcal{N}_{ij}}).
\end{equation*}
 
According to the Hammersley and Clifford
Theorem\cite{besag_spatial_1974}, $\vec x$ is Markov random field if
and only if it is also a Gibbs distribution, defined as
\begin{equation}
  P(\vec x) = \frac{1}{Z}\exp\left(-U(\vec x)\right), 
\end{equation}
where $U$ is the energy function $U(\vec x) = \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} V_c$,
with potentials $V_c$ defined for each clique $c$ in the clique set
$\mathcal{C}$. The partition function $Z = \sum \exp(-U(\vec x))$ is a
normalizing constant, where the summation is over all possible configurations of
$\vec x$. We use a particular form of MRF---the Ising model---which is a
commonly used model for MRFs with binary states. In this model the energy
function is given by
\begin{equation}
U(\vec x) = - \beta \sum_{\langle ij, mn \rangle} x_{ij} x_{mn},
 \label{eq:A1}
\end{equation}
where the summation is over all edges $\langle ij, mn \rangle$, i.e., all
adjacent voxel pairs $(i,j), (m,n)$ in the connectivity graph. When $\beta > 0$,
this definition favors similarity of neighbors.

\subsection{Likelihood Model}
We now define the likelihood model, $P(\vec y \, | \, \vec x)$, which connects
the observed data $\vec y$ to our MRF. Because we are interested in the
functional connectivity between pairs of voxels, we compute the correlation
between the time courses of each pair of voxels, and get a correlation matrix
$\vec y = \{y_{ij}\}$. Just as in the case of the random field $\vec x$, the
correlation matrix $\vec y$ is also defined on the $2d$-dimensional lattice
$\mathcal{S}$. Linear correlation is not the only choice for $\vec y$. We can
use any statistic, as long as it indicates the affinity between two voxel time
series. Another possibility could be frequency domain measures, such as the
coherence~\cite{mller_multivariate_2001,thirion_detection_2006}.

<<<<<<< .mine
The linear correlation is not the only choice for $\vec y$. We can use
any statistics between time series as long as it indicates the
``affinity'' between two voxels. For example, coherence
\cite{mller_multivariate_2001} in
frequency domain can be good choice if the interest is on the
frequency property of the data.
=======
Before defining the full data likelihood, we start with a definition of the {\em
  emission function} at a single site $(i, j) \in \mathcal{S}$. This is defined
as the conditional likelihood, $P(y_{ij} \, | \, x_{ij})$, which is interpreted
as the probability of the observed correlation, given the state of the
connectivity between voxels $i$ and $j$. We model the emission function as a
Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variance on the Fisher transformed
correlation $y_{ij}$. Notice that each correlation $y_{ij}$ on site $s_{ij}$
only depends on the latent variable $x_{ij}$ on the same site, and does not
depend on neighbors of $x_{ij}$. Therefore, the full likelihood is given by
\begin{equation}
P(\vec y \, | \, \vec x) = \prod_{s_{ij}\in\mathcal{S}} P(y_{ij} \, | \, x_{ij}).
\end{equation}
>>>>>>> .r49

With both prior and conditional likelihood available, we define the posterior as
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
P(x_{ij}  = k \, | \, y_{ij}) &\prop P(x_{ij}) P(y_{ij} \, | \, x_{ij})\\
&\prop \exp\{\beta\sum_{mn \in \mathcal{N}_{ij}}x_{ij} x_{mn} \} \exp \{ -\frac{(x_{ij} -
  \mu_k)^2}{2\sigma_k^2} - \log(\sigma_k)\}
\end{array}
 \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}


\section{Estimation via Expectation Maximization}
\label{sec:algorithm}
Once the prior and likelihood models are available, we also need to know the
model's parameters, the $\beta$ in \eqref{eq:A1} and $(\mu, \sigma^2)$ in
\eqref{eq:1}. If the connectivity variable $\vec x$ is available, we can
estimate them by maximizing the joint probability $P(\vec x, \vec y)$. However,
to know $\vec x$, we again need to compute posterior, which need the parameters.

we use a Expectation-Maximization method to alternate the above two
steps iteratively. In \textbf{E} step, with properly initialized
parameters, we compute the posterior probability for each $x_{ij}$,
and sample $x_{ij}$ from posterior distribution by Gibbs Sampling. We
then compute the expected value of each connectivity node by mean
field theory. Mean field is computed by replacing the neighbor
$x_{mn}$ in \eqref{eq:1} by its expected value $\langle
x_{mn}\rangle$. After we compute the posterior of current point
$x_{ij}$, we update $x_{ij}$ with its expected value $\langle x_{ij}
\rangle$.

In \textbf{M} step, with $\vec \langle \vec x \rangle$ and data $\vec
y$, the complete data set $\{\langle\vec x\rangle, \vec y\}$ is
available, and the parameters can be estimated by Maximizing the
pseudo joint likelihood\cite{li_markov_2009,besag_spatial_1974}
\begin{equation}
PL(\vec x, \vec y) = \prod_{ij}^{}P (x_{ij}|x_{\mathcal{N}_{ij}}) P(y_{ij}|x_{ij}). \label{eq:2}
\end{equation}
Since this is quadratic
function of parameters $\beta$, $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, Newton's method
is used to find the global maximum.  After some EM iterations, we get
stable parameters, an additional annealing procedure
\cite{geman_stochastic_1984} is followed to get the final MAP estimation.

The whole algorithm involves updating a high dimensional connectivity
matrix $\vec x$, iteratively and hence have high computation cost. We
designed a parallel Markov random field updating strategy on graphics
processing unit (GPU). The algorithm take only a few minutes compared
with more than 1 hour on CPU counterpart.

To fit the algorithm into GPU's architecture, we use some special
strategy. First, because GPU only support 3-dimensional array, we need
to reshape $\vec x$ and $\vec y$ defined originally on higher
dimensional graph by linear indexing their original subscripts. This
is especially difficult for brain fMRI data because the gray matter
voxels resides in a irregular 3-D lattice. Specific data structure are
used for mapping between original voxel subscripts and their linear
index $i$ and $j$. Second, to parallel updating each site of MRF we
have to make sure a site is not updated simultaneously with its
neighbors, otherwise the field tends to be stuck in a
checkerboard-like local maximum. Our strategy is to divide all the
sites of the field into sub-groups, such that a site is not in the
same sub-group with its neighbors.  We then can update the sub-group
sequentially. The whole procedure is in algorithm \ref{alg:1}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

{\bf Synthetic Data.} We first construct a synthetic data set. This is
$100\times 1$ 1-D image with each pixel a time course signal. The time
course was constructed with sine waves plus additive Gaussian noise of
variance.  We only add sine wave signal in \emph{some} time series
while others are purely Gaussian noise. The goal is to see the
connectivity between the 1-D image with itself. We know Between those
pixels containing signals the connectivity is $1$, otherwise it is $0$
for connectivity between signal and noise, and between noise time
series. The true connectivity map is in fig. \ref{fig:1a}

To compare our MRF model with conventional correlation after spatial
blurring, we do both tests on the same data set and have the results
in fig. \ref{fig:1}. on the correlation map of top row, we see
smoothing does remove noise and after smoothing the correlation map
looks more like true connectivity map. However it also smoothed out
small interested regions and leads to more false positive as can be
seen from fig \ref{fig:1e}. By using MRF, fig. \ref{fig:1f} shows true
connectivity region's structure is detected and most false positive
are removed.

% In fig. \ref{fig:1}, direct thresholding of correlation map
% (\ref{fig:1c}) or standard Gaussian mixture model (\ref{fig:1d}) does
% not use pixels' spatial context information, hence can not give a
% spatial coherent connectivity region. By using MRF in prior
% distribution, our method in fig. \ref{fig:1e} is able to get a
% clustered region while removing other scattered false positive points.

{\bf Resting-State fMRI.} Next we tested our method on real data from
healthy control subjects in a resting-state fMRI study. BOLD EPI
images (TR= 2.0 s, TE = 28 ms, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2, 40
slices at 3 mm slice thickness, 64 x 64 matrix, 240 volumes) were
acquired on a Siemens 3 Tesla Trio scanner with 12-channel head coil
during the resting state, eyes open. The data was motion corrected by
SPM software and registered to T2 structural image. Segmentation is
done on T2 to get a mask image so only gray matter voxels are counted
in the connectivity analysis. We do \emph{not} spatially smooth the
data, in order to the benefit of replacing spatial smoothing with
MRF. Before computing correlation, time series at all voxels are
linear detrended by least square regression.

The resulting connectivity map contains the posterior probability of
connection between any two voxels in the gray matter. By maximizing a
Posterior the voxels with posterior map $>0.5$ to obtain the voxel
pairs that are most likely to be connected.
