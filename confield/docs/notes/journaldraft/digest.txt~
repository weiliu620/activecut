-- functional network structure can be revealed by investigating the behavior of the BOLD function.
-- Areas of task-specific brain activity could be indirectly defined. 
-- basal activity of the brain.
-- With resting state fMRI data, it is evident that the brain can be segmented into regions of correlated BOLD signal fluctuations. (Aviv Mezer, cluster analysis of ...)
-- Spontaneous neural activity.
-- Conventional fMRI analysis.
-- A number of signal processing schemes have been suggested for analyzing the resting-state BOLD signal, ranging from simple correlation to spectral decomposition of frequency analysis.
-- Network approaches have already revealed significant between-subject variability in structural and functional connectivity, so the role of variations in networks for variable cognition and behavior will likely be an intense area of future research. 

-- \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0044428} has a discussion that simple averaging
subjects network is not the best way of estimating group network. This can be
used in our paper as a reference.

-- Need to talk a little about the "resting state" is actually not resting. Search google bookmark for a blog talking this issue.
