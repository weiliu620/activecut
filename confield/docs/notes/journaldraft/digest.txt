-- functional network structure can be revealed by investigating the behavior of the BOLD function.
-- Areas of task-specific brain activity could be indirectly defined. 
-- basal activity of the brain.
-- With resting state fMRI data, it is evident that the brain can be segmented into regions of correlated BOLD signal fluctuations. (Aviv Mezer, cluster analysis of ...)
-- Spontaneous neural activity.
-- Conventional fMRI analysis.
-- A number of signal processing schemes have been suggested for analyzing the resting-state BOLD signal, ranging from simple correlation to spectral decomposition of frequency analysis.
-- Network approaches have already revealed significant between-subject variability in structural and functional connectivity, so the role of variations in networks for variable cognition and behavior will likely be an intense area of future research. 

-- \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0044428} has a discussion that simple averaging
subjects network is not the best way of estimating group network. This can be
used in our paper as a reference.

<<<< Random Thoughts >>>>
-- Need to talk a little about the "resting state" is actually not resting. Search google bookmark for a blog talking this issue.

-- Need 17 network results. 
-- Need to talk about why ICC does not apply to our experiments? the within session error vs between session error, a relative metric. 
-- Need a method (such as cross-validation) for the value of alpha parameter.
-- Do we need to add the conversion from bayesian network to MRF network, i.e. the moralizatoin etc?
-- Mention that a much smaller spatial smoothing kernel is needed for the data used in MRF.
-- mention the weakness of the algorithm: slow.
-- plot the parameter estimation, and the objective function of EM. 

-- Read Yeo's paper.
-- Read Dropbox topics of consistency test.
-- ICC can be used for posterior map?

--- Issue: Session1 and 2 are month apart, but 2 and 3 are just 45 minutes apart. We
do not take into account such time intervals.
