I can use lasso to select variables and linear regression.

- write the Anderson's seed as a image file and check it. 
- batch_process each subject.
- compute ROI signal and compute connectivity.
- preprocess the features (selection, regression of age etc)

-- Note the paper of Meier "The group lasso for logistric regression". Before
   hierarchical settings, we can use group lasso for the data from all
   sites. There is a grplasso package in R from the same author.

There are 3 options with different level of difficulty: 1) Group lasso, without
hierarchy. 2) Define the classification as a lienar regression problem (refer to
Hastie book, either ch 4 or ch 18). Solving the subject sparse offset is
easy. Soving the group coefficients set is hard. Need to rederive the Lasso
solution. 3) Use logistic regression. Solving subject gamma offset is not
straightforard but doable (I've derived the formula. Can fit into IRLS solver),
but solving the group parameter is extremely hard, but still doable. Need to
re-derive the logistic lasso formular, and can not re-use the IRLS solver.
