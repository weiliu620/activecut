R1: 1. Our method is a Bayesian approach, i.e., an MRF prior on the labels and maximum a posteriori segmentation. The Bayesian framework is very important, because this enforces spatial coherence in the functional networks. This is the main goal of the paper. Second, we use priors on the parameters (kappa, sigma) to prevent degenerate solutions, e.g., a single label dominating the entire image.

2. We agree this sentence was unclear. We empirically tune the hyperparameters for kappa/sigma distributions and have found the results to be robust to specific choices of the hyperparameters. We'll add this in the paper.

3. The neighborhood is the usual 6 adjacent voxels, which does not overly smooth across boundaries. Previous works (e.g., [4, 8]) have demonstrated the advantages of MRF's over Gaussian smoothing in preserving segment boundaries.

4. We chose 3 time points because they can be visualized on a 2-sphere. The goal was not to synthesize realistic brain data, but rather have a ground truth comparison of MCEM and a mode-approximation method (ICM here). As described in the text, the time series were generated by sampling from von-Mises Fisher, and these clusters are plotted in Fig 1.

5. For ICA we choose 16 components. The component map is converted to a z score and thresholded at 1. Even spatial ICA (Calhoun 2001) does not take into account spatial correlations (smoothness), it only ensures spatially independent component maps. It still often produces spurious/scattered labels. We agree that the single-subject visual and dorsal attention networks have more variability, but group analysis (future work) will alleviate this issue.

R2: Validation: we have results for 16 subjects and only show 3 of them because of space limitations. We will add an entropy measure of consistency amongst the 16 subjects (our method vs. ICA). Our approach naturally extends to group analysis using hierarchical Bayesian concepts (future work).

R3: Our work is related to Golland 2008, which we referenced, as we both use von-Mises Fisher. However, the main contribution of our paper is the MRF spatial prior, which entails MCEM. Golland uses no spatial prior. Also, the MCEM is not costly (only a few minutes).

Selecting the number of components is a model-selection problem and is future work.

Since there is no ground truth, we compared our results to those of ICA qualitatively to show that our method has more biologically-plausible spatial coherence.
