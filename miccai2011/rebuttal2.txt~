[Review 1, comment 1] Disagree. we assign a label to each voxel to
indicate which functional network it belongs to. This labeling is
assumed to be piecewise smooth in the whole brain, and we use Markov
random field as a prior to model this [sec 2.1].  a Maximum a Posterior
estimation is then used to estimate the label map. Moreover, we define
hyperpriors on the \kappa parameter of conditional
likelihood (von Mises) at sec. 2.2. All these leads to a Bayesian method.

[Review 1, comment 2] We assume a non-informative (flat) prior on
/kappa and get estimation of /kappa's, which are used to get empirical
value of hyperparameters (mu_kappa and sigma_kappa). We can add above
to the final version.
