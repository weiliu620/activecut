Dear editors,

Please find the attached manuscript submitted to NeuroImage for publication. This is the initial submission. The manuscript introduces a new method for estimating human brain's functional network from a group of subjects' resting state functional MRI data. The method defines a hierarchical structure of the network maps that takes into account the similarity and variation between the subjects in the same group. This is a response to the challenges of analyzing the large dataset in the recent human connectome project (HCP). As stated in the article "HCP: a data acquisition perspective" by D.C. Van Essen, a key objective is to understand inter-individual variability of brain circuits...rather than merely aiming to determine the average, or typical connectivity in healthy adults.  In this work, we use a Bayesian framework that can estimate both the average functional network map, and individual subject's map. The method also integrates the within-subject spatial constraints in the same model, and estimate the parameters in a data-driven fashion. 

We believe the method will be an interesting alternative to the standard independent component analysis method, particularly for people studying large data sets from multiple sources. 

Thank you for the consideration,

Sincerely,
