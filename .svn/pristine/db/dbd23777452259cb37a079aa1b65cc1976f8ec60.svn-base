% 1) fMRI measures the blood oxygenation, and indirectly detect the neuronal
% activity. 2) fMRI have been widely used for the neural basis of the
% perception, cognition and emotion. 3) traditionally has been focusing on the
% regions that shows task-related increases in neural activity. 4) rs-fMRI
% detects the neuronal activity during rest.

% Why interested in resting-state? 1) some regions has greater activity in
% baseline state than during experimental task (DMN) 2) enhance understanding of
% neural activity in baseline states. 3) refine interpretation of activation and
% deactivation.

% mental process. 

% The DMN is only slightly disrupted during passive sensory processing task, but
% is suspended during cognitively demanding external tasks.
