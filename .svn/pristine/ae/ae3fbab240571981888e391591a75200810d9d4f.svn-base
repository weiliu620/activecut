\begin{abstract}
Recently graph cuts based image segmentation methods have been successfully applied to computer vision and medical imaging fields.
   The user-interactive nature of these methods allow user to iteratively refine the current segmentation to improve
   the result. However, without any guidance or suggestion from the algorithm itself, the user interaction can be viewed as a passive process and it can take much longer time to get a user desired result. Moreover, most of the time, graph cuts based methods are designed to segment single object in the image/volume which is not appropriate to multi-object segmentation. Some researchers have proposed to use active learning to make suggestion to users at each iteration of the graph cuts based algorithm. However, the framework only works for single object segmentation which is difficult to extend to the multi-object scenario. In the paper, we propose a unified framework to integrate active learning to graph cuts algorithm for multi-object segmentation tasks. To enforce the smoothness of the segmentation, we use both MRF and spatial priors (in the case we have).

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Graph cuts based user-interactive image segmentation methods have been successfully applied to computer vision, computer graphics, and medical imaging fields \cite{boykov2001fast,rother2004grabcut}. However, the user interaction process is entirely based on user's observation or intuition without any guidance or suggestion from segmentation algorithms. Therefore, the user interaction can be viewed as a passive learning process which is the bottle neck of the whole algorithm. On the other hand, most of these methods are designed to segment single object in the image. It is difficult to extend them to segment multiple objects. In this paper, we propose to integrate active learning to graph cuts segmentation to solve both user interaction and multiple objects segmentation problems.

Several researchers have applied active learning to image segmentation \cite{top2011active,iglesias2011combining,veeraraghavan2011active}.
Veeraraghavan et al.\cite{veeraraghavan2011active} proposed an algorithm in which segmentation is performed by grow cut and uncertainty of segmentation is estimated by SVM to give suggestion to user. The drawbacks of this method are: the segmentation and uncertainty estimation are separated, the algorithm is for single object segmentation, and the suggestion for user are pixels which are not informative and not compact.
We propose a new objective function for both graph cuts segmentation and uncertainty estimation for active learning which naturally put both components into one unified framework.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We apply our analysis to multimodal image data of five TBI patients with large lesions.  Each subject was scanned at two time points, an acute scan at $\approx$ 5 days and
another chronic scan at $\approx$ 6 months post injury.
The image data of each subject include T1, T2, FLAIR, and GRE modalities.
Fig.~\ref{fig:FiveSubjectsT1} illustrates T1 images of five subjects at the acute stage.
