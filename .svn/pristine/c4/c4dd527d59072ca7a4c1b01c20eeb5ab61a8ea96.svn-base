%% Recently graph cuts based image segmentation methods have been successfully
%% applied to computer vision and medical imaging fields.  The user-interactive
%% nature of these methods allow user to iteratively refine the current
%% segmentation to improve the result. However, without any guidance or suggestion
%% from the algorithm itself, the user interaction can be viewed as a passive
%% process and it can take much longer time to get a user desired result. Moreover,
%% most of the time, graph cuts based methods are designed to segment single object
%% in the image/volume which is not appropriate to multi-object segmentation. Some
%% researchers have proposed to use active learning to make suggestion to users at
%% each iteration of the graph cuts based algorithm. However, the framework only
%% works for single object segmentation which is difficult to extend to the
%% multi-object scenario. In the paper, we propose a unified framework to integrate
%% active learning to graph cuts algorithm for multi-object segmentation tasks. To
%% enforce the smoothness of the segmentation, we use both MRF and spatial priors
%% (in the case we have).
We proposed a novel semi-supervised method for segmentation of longitudinal
traumatic brain injury images with multiple lesion regions. Standard GrabCut
algorithm passively wait for user to refine the segmentation map. This is
difficult in 3D space. In our method, we use the active learning technique where
the algorithm actively selects the candidate regions for querying the user, and
obtains the most informative user feedback. The active learning also releases
the user's burden since the user simply answers `yes' or `no' to a candidate
object instead of refining the map slice by slice. Our method is able to detect
multiple lesion regions, and we obtain smooth segmentation maps and submit
spatially-coherent objects for querying users by using Markov random field. The
statistical inference problem is solved by graph cuts and variational inference
methods. The results show significant performance gain with a few user
involvement.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% This paragraph need revision.
the traumatic brain injury (TBI) image segmentation is a complex task due to its
multiple lesions, multi-modalities, and lack of prior knowledge of lesions'
location. The state-of-art image segmentation algorithms often fail to find the
true lesions, with high false-positive rate for single lesion detection, and
high false-negative rate in multiple lesion detection. Graph cuts based
user-interactive image segmentation methods have been successfully applied to
computer vision, computer graphics, and medical imaging fields
\cite{boykov2001fast,rother2004grabcut}. For TBI images, a standalone algorithm
such as graph cuts could not achieve good results without a human expert's
involvement. We note a little user input at the right time and right place can
significantly improve the algorithm's performance. GrabCut
method~\cite{rother2004grabcut} integrates human experts' knowledge and the
algorithm's computation power. In GrabCut, one typically gives an initial guess
of the region of interest, for example a bounding box. The algorithm estimates
an globally optimal boundary between the normal and abnormal regions. The user
then inspects the segmentation results, and adjusts the boundary by drawing a
region as a hard constraint. Such process works well on two dimensional natural
images, as human being can usually quickly find the incorrectly classified
regions. However, the process will be a significant burden to the user once
applied on 3D volume image, since one has to visually inspect each slice and
correct it. The crux is the process is entirely based on user's active
inspection and correction. The algorithm is in a \emph{passive learning} state,
taking whatever the user gives as input. Therefore, the user has to take the
responsibility of looking for possible multiple objects, and the GrabCut
algorithm just refines the boundaries of the candidate objects. This passive
learning process is the bottleneck of the GrabCut algorithm when applied in
3D data.

\caption{Flowchart of the proposed algorithm.}
\label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure}

In this work we propose a new method that uses active learning technique for
interactive segmentation of the TBI images. We adopt a minimalist's philosophy
such that our algorithm need the least amount of user's involvement. By active
learning, the algorithm queries the user only on the most important data
point. As a result, the user's response to such query will be the most
informative, and the number of user interaction is minimized before the
algorithm reaches certain estimation accuracy. Even better, the algorithm has
the potential of automatically classifying the unlabeled data without user's
input, and re-learn the model based on the updated labeled data.  This
self-training further decrease the user involvement, without losing segmentation
accuracy. We refer the proposed algorithm as \emph{active-cut}.

Another contribution of work is the algorithm is able to detect multiple
lesions. Standard graph cut algorithm~\cite{rother2004grabcut} only detects
single object. Our active-cut algorithm learns the model from a simple user
initialization, find the candidate objects and submit to user for
inspection. The user is now in an passive state, by just answering a `yes' or
`no' question to the queried candidates. The active-cut algorithm does the
remaining work including refining the candidate objects, learning model
parameters and running graph cut algorithm for a globally optimal map.

Another contribution of our work is the introduction of the spatial context
constraints by Markov random field (MRF). Besides the energy term of the graph
cut's objective function to get smooth boundary between normal and abnormal
regions, we also define a MRF prior on label variables within the normal and
abnormal class. The estimated label maps within both classes will be piecewise
constant. We also define the MRF prior on the candidate objects submitted to the
user, so the candidates are spatially coherent objects instead of single voxels.

% space is limited, we may need to split this paragraph into small pieces and
% plug into previous paragraph.
Several researchers have applied active learning to image segmentation
\cite{top2011active,iglesias2011combining,veeraraghavan2011active}.
Veeraraghavan et al.\cite{veeraraghavan2011active} use grow cut for segmentation
and estimates the uncertainty by support vector machine classifier. We are
different from their methods in that instead of learning new voxels, our method
learn the new objects because of their better fit for human visual perception. 

In the remaining part of the paper, we discuss the model and processing pipeline
in section \ref{sec:method}, give the segmentation results in section
\ref{sec:results} and conclude in \ref{sec:conc}.


%% algorithm in

%% this method are: the segmentation and uncertainty estimation are separated, the
%% algorithm is for single object segmentation, and the suggestion for user are

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
\subsection{Image segmentation by Graph Cuts}
Following GrabCut~\cite{rother2004grabcut}, we build two mixture of Gaussian
(GMM) models for the normal brain regions and the lesions, and use the
expectation maximization (EM) method to estimate both the class labels and the
model parameters $\theta$. In the graph cut step, the algorithm takes model
parameters of both GMMs as input, and estimates a hard label $\alpha \in \{0,
1\}$ representing if each voxel $n$ is normal ($\alpha_n =0 $) or lesions
($\alpha_n = 1$). Besides the smoothness
constraint on the lesion boundary, we also apply MRF constraints on the label
maps within normal and lesions. This soft constraint guarantee the estimated
labels is smooth.

\noindent \textbf{Within-Class MRF}: Define the label map $\mat z = \{\vec z_1,
\dots, \vec z_N\}$, where $\vec z_n$ is a K dimensional binary random variable
for voxel $n$ such that $\sum_k \!z_{nk} \!=\! 1$. A particular element
$z_{nk}\!=\!1$ indicates voxel $n$ is in Gaussian component $k$. The prior
distribution of $\mat z$ takes into account the MRF constraints as well as the
atlas, and is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  p(\mat z) = \frac{1}{C} \exp( \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K z_{nk} \log \pi_{nk} + \beta \sum_{(n,m)} \langle \vec z_n, \vec z_m \rangle ),
\end{equation*}
where $\pi_{nk}$ is the atlas prior probability of $n$ being in component $k$,
$(n, m)$ is pair of neighboring voxels, and $\langle, \rangle$ is the inner
product of two vectors, representing our preference of piecewise constant label
map, with the constraint strength given by $\beta$. Given $\vec z_n$, the
likelihood function is defined as multivariate Gaussian $p(\vec x_n | \vec z_n)
= \mathcal{N}(\vec x_n; \theta(\vec z_n))$, with $\vec x_n$ the observed data
vector of the multi-modality images at $n$. In EM, one need to evaluate
$\mathbb{E}_{P(\mat z |\mat x)} [\log p(\mat x, \mat z)]$, which is intractable
due to the MRF prior on $\mat z$. Here we use the variational inference method
that iteratively updates $p(\vec z_n|\vec z_{\mathcal{N}(n)}, \vec x_n)$ given
the expected value of $\vec z_n$'s neighbors $\mathcal{N}(n)$. The update
equation takes the form
\begin{equation*}
  \log p(z_{nk}) = z_{nk} \pi_{nk} + \!\!\!\!\! \sum_{m\in \mathcal{N}(n)} \!\!\!\langle \overline {\vec z}_m, \vec z_n \rangle + \log \mathcal{N} (\vec x_n; \theta(\vec z_n)),
\end{equation*}
where $\overline {\vec z}_m$ is the expected value at neighbor $m$. We
compute $\log p(z_{nk})$ for all $k$ and compute $p(\vec z_n)$ by taking
exponential and normalize. $\overline{z}_n$ is just $p(\vec z_n)$ for binary
variables and is used for updating $\vec z_n$'s neighbors. In M step, we
use $\mat z$ to estimate $\theta = \{\mu, \Sigma\}$ for all components. The
variational procedure stops when no $\vec z_n$ changes. Given $\alpha$, EM runs
on both GMM separately, with a uniform atlas map on lesion's GMM.

%% \noindent \textbf{Graph Cuts global optimization: }We define the objective
%% function of graph cuts optimization as
%% % possible to move two energy term in to text. Just keep E(alpha) here.
%% \begin{align*}
%%   &\mat E(\alpha) = \gamma \sum_{(m,n)} \psi(\alpha_n, \alpha_m) \exp \left ( -\beta_0 \| \vec x_n - \vec x_m\|^2 \right ) +\\
%%   & \sum_n^N \mathbb{E}_{p(\mat z|\mat x)} \log p(\vec x_n, \vec z_n; \theta (\alpha)),
  %% &\mathbb{E}_{p(\mat z|\mat x)} \log p(\vec x, \vec z; \theta (\alpha_n)) = \!\!\sum_{k=1}^K \!z_{nk}(\log \pi_{nk} \!+\! \log \mathcal{N}(\vec x_n; \theta(\alpha_n))) \!+\!  \beta \!\!\!\!\!\!\sum_{m \in \mathcal{N}(n)} \!\!\!\!\!\langle \vec z_n, \!\vec z_m\rangle \!-\! \log C \!\!\!\!,
%% \end{align*}
%% where $\psi = 1$ if $\alpha_n \neq \alpha_m$, otherwise $\psi = 0$, and
%% $\beta_0$ is estimated from data by taking expectation over image
%% sample~\cite{boykov2001fast,rother2004grabcut}. The smoothness constraint
%% depends on the data term, so it is a conditional random field. When building the
%% graph, we set the T-link by the second term, and the N-link by the first term in
%% the above equation.

\subsection{Active Learning New Lesion Object}

% Gives a short intro of active learning with (just one) reference. Why active
% learning, benefit. How that works in general. Then talk about our
% strategy. Need to mention self-training (automatically add unlabeled data into
% labeled dataset, thus decreasing user interaction/burden).

%% We use graph cuts~\cite{rother2004grabcut} to update the voxel's $\alpha$ value
%% within the bounding box. Once the EM and graph-cut converges, the algorithm
%% enters into the active-learning step. In the graph-cut, we do not move the
%% voxels in normal region into the lesions in order to control the false positive
%% detection. 

In the active learning step, the algorithm take the $\alpha$ and $\theta$ as
input, and computes the probability of each voxel in the normal region belonging
to the lesions. It then builds a connected component map, since such a
high-level object-based representation is convenient for user interaction. We
sort the multiple objects in a descending order of the probability of being in
the lesion regions, and submit the top object for user to query. Even better,
when the algorithm believes the top object should be in the lesion with
sufficient confidence, it adds the object into lesion in a self-training process
without querying users, hence further reducing the user involvement.

% How the query score are computed. (LW will add stuff here)
\noindent\textbf{Query Score: }The log-odds of $\alpha$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
  a = \log p(\alpha=1) + \mathbb{E}_{p(\vec z_n|\vec x_n)} \log p(\vec x_n, \vec z_n; \theta (\alpha=1))\\
  - \log p(\alpha=0) + \mathbb{E}_{p(\vec z_n|\vec x_n)} \log p(\vec x_n, \vec z_n; \theta (\alpha=0)),
\end{align*}
where the $p(\alpha)$ is assumed to be a MRF. The predictive probability of a
voxel being in lesion is computed by the standard logistic function
$p(\alpha_n=1|\vec x_n) = 1/ (1 + \exp (-a))$. We obtain a binary map $\vec w$
by thresholding the predictive map at 0.5, and identify a series of objects
$R_i$ by running a connected component routine on $\vec w$. To further select
the most salient objects, we sort the objects in decending order of the
following score:
\begin{align}
q(R_i) = \sum_{n\in R_i} p(\alpha = 1| \vec x_n) / \vert\{n: n\in \mathcal{B}(R_i) \}\vert
\label{eq:score}
\end{align}
The $\mathcal{B}(R)$ is the set of voxels on the boundary of $R$, and the
denominator denotes the number of voxels on the boundary of $R_i$. The above
query score prefers objects with larger volumes of posterior probability. The
score also prefers blob-like objects since such object has large volume-surface
ratio. Such criteria reflects our prior knowledge on the lesion object's shape.

% Give a summary of the pipeline. and give reference of pipeline's figure.
\noindent\textbf{Processing Pipeline: } With all the setting above, the learning
pipeline is given in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}. Given the bounding box from
user, we initialize the $\alpha$ map such that $\alpha = 1$ (lesion) within the
bounding box, and $\alpha = 0$ outside. The GMM learns $\theta$ of both GMMs
given $\alpha$, then a graph-cut step~\cite{rother2004grabcut} updates only the
$\alpha$ for voxels within the box. This update strategy of graph-cuts prevents
false-positive detections. Upon EM + graph cuts convergence, there may be some
false-negative voxels outside the box. We group these voxels into spatially
coherent objects and find the one with highest score computed from
\eqref{eq:score}. The algorithm either automatically add the candidate to
lesions or queries user for answer, depending on its confidence on the
candidate. We then update the hard-constraint map to reflect the knowledge
learned from the new object, and a new EM + graph cuts iteration starts. This
iteration repeats until user stops the learning process. We run this active-cut
algorithm on the longitudinal datasets of both time points.

\noindent\textbf{4D modeling Pathological Anatomy: }In order to estimate
deformations from a healthy template to each time point and evaluate mapping
between time points, the result of active learning based Graph cuts, likelihood,
is used for modeling pathological anatomy.  This follows the 4D pathological
anatomy modeling framework of Wang et al. \cite{WangMBIA2013}.  The estimated
likelihood, $p( I_{t}(x) | c, \theta_t^c )$, can be plugged into the data
functional $\mathcal{F}(A, \phi_t, Q_t) = $
\begin{equation}
- \sum_{t=1}^T \, \sum_{x=1}^N \, \log \, ( \, \sum_{c=1}^C P_t^{c}(x) \, p( I_{t}(x) | c, \theta_t^c ) \, )
\end{equation}
where the spatial prior $P_t^c$ for each class $c$ at time point $t$ is
$P_t^c = A^c \circ \phi_t + Q_t^c$,
and $A$ is the tissue class probability that is initially associated with the
healthy template, $\phi_t$ is the diffeomorphic deformation from time $t$ to the
atlas, and $Q_t$ is the non-diffeomorphic probabilistic change for time $t$.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We applied our method to multi-modality image data of four TBI patients with
large lesions.  Each subject was scanned twice, an acute scan at about 5 days
and another chronic scan at 6 months post injury. Each subject's data includes
T1, T2, FLAIR, and GRE. For lesions' GMM model, we choose $K=2$ for bleeding and
edema component, and for normal regions we choose $K=3$ for gray matter, white
matter and CSF. We take 6 neighborhood system and choose
the smoothness parameter $\gamma = \beta = 1$. The image intensity of each
modality is normalized to the range [0, 255] before the learning process. We
also run K-Means 5 times with different initialization, and use the K-Means
clustering with the atlas prior map to initialize the GMM.
% need to say: the number of components of the Gaussian mixture model is set to
% 3 for normal region (GM, WM, CSF) and 2 for lesion area (edema, bleeding) to
% reflect our prior knowledge.

% This paragraph give some procedure, which should be in the previsou method
% section. This is just fore result.
Fig.~\ref{fig:userinter} shows the dynamic learning process of subject 1. In
iteration 1, the hard constraint is the bounding box of user input and therefore
the foreground alpha map is restricted in the bounding box. In the second
iteration, since user accepted one candidate patch, and then the hard constraint
was updated accordingly. We see this user-accepted patch is actually connected
to the bounding box. This is one advantage of our algorithm which doesn't
require user to give perfect bounding box for lesions. This is a good feature
because in practice it's extremely difficult and time-consuming to ask user to
give a good 3D bounding box to include one major lesion area. In the third
iteration, user rejected one candidate patch and accepted a second one. The
user-accepted patch is not connected to the major lesion but our algorithm is
still able to capture it, this is another advantage of our algorithm. Not like
regular GrabCut~\cite{rother2004grabcut}, it's designed for single object
segmentation. Our algorithm is able to segment multiple objects and actively
provide user candidate patches which makes the user interaction more
efficiently.  Another advantage of our algorithm is that by combing volume,
predictive probability, and shape information, most of the top-ranked patches
are actually true candidates. This further makes the user interaction
efficiently since if many top-ranked patches are wrong candidates, user will
have to reject many patches to be able to get good segmentation.  During the
iterations of user interaction, every user accepted or rejected candidate patch
is recorded and then used as mask in the following iterations to avoid to
recommend the same patch to users.

In order to show the efficacy of the proposed method, we use the GrabCut without user interaction as baseline method and allow background change to foreground freely so that foreground segmentation is not restricted in the initial bounding box.
Fig.~\ref{fig:QualComp} shows the qualitative comparison of the baseline method and the acCut and  Table~\ref{tab:DiceResult} shows the quantitative comparison of both methods. 
From both qualitative and quantitative result, we see that the proposed method is able to significantly improve the segmentation. This kind of result is because there is no atlas for lesions, therefore without user interaction the algorithm tends to converge to bad local minimum (i.e., too large or too small lesion segmentation). Smart and efficient user-interactive method may give us better result \textemdash this is the rational behind the proposed algorithm.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
We presented a semi-supervised method for modeling longitudinal MR images of
severe TBI patients with multiple lesion regions.  The major component of our
algorithm is active learning based segmentation which allows efficient user
interaction. Compare to standard GrabCut, our method has several advantages.
First, instead of passively waiting user to discover the missing segmentation
area, our method actively recommend coherent patch to users to decide if it is
true candidate.  Second, our algorithm is able to capture multiple objects which
is common is severe TBI case but the standard GrabCut is designed for single
object.  By taking the rough bounding box into account, integrating different
features of candidate patch, and keeping track of the user interaction, our
algorithm is able to make the user interaction easy, robust and efficiently to
segment multiple lesions.  We also used MRF to enforce the smoothness of FG/BG
segmentation and the provide user spatially-coherent object for query. Both
quantitative and qualitative results show that our method is able to improve
segmentation significantly and therefore improve the following 4D modeling.  In
the future, we'd like to validate our method using a large data set.
