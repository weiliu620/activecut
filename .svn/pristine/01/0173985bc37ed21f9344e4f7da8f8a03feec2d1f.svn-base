\begin{abstract}
Recently graph cuts based image segmentation methods have been successfully
applied to computer vision and medical imaging fields.  The user-interactive
nature of these methods allow user to iteratively refine the current
segmentation to improve the result. However, without any guidance or suggestion
from the algorithm itself, the user interaction can be viewed as a passive
process and it can take much longer time to get a user desired result. Moreover,
most of the time, graph cuts based methods are designed to segment single object
in the image/volume which is not appropriate to multi-object segmentation. Some
researchers have proposed to use active learning to make suggestion to users at
each iteration of the graph cuts based algorithm. However, the framework only
works for single object segmentation which is difficult to extend to the
multi-object scenario. In the paper, we propose a unified framework to integrate
active learning to graph cuts algorithm for multi-object segmentation tasks. To
enforce the smoothness of the segmentation, we use both MRF and spatial priors
(in the case we have).

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Graph cuts based user-interactive image segmentation methods have been
successfully applied to computer vision, computer graphics, and medical imaging
fields \cite{boykov2001fast,rother2004grabcut}. For some complex images, a
standalone computer algorithm can not achieve good segmentation without a human
expert's involvemnet. GrabCut method [reference] is a powerful tool for
integrating human experts' knowledge and the computer algorithm's power. In
GrabCut, one typically gives an initial guess of the region of interest, for
example a bounding box. The algorithm estimates an globally optimal boundary
between the foreground and background regions. The user then inspects the
segmentation results, and adjust the boundary by drawing a region as a hard
constraint. Such process works well on two dimensional natural images, as human
being can usually quickly find the incorrectly classified regions. However, the
process will be a significant burden in 3D volume image since the user has to
visually inspect each slice and correct it.

% issues of grabcuts, 2d->3d, passive-->active.
One reason of such a burdening interaction process is the process is entirely
based on user's active inspection and correction. The algorithm is in a
\emph{passive learning} state, taking whatever the user gives as
input. Therefore, the user has to take the responsibility of looking for
possible multiple objects, and the GrabCut algorithm refines the boundaries of
the candidate objects. This passive learning process is the bottle network of
the GrabCut algorithm when applied in 3D data.

In this work we propose a new method that uses active learning technique for
interactive segmentation of the Traumatic brain injury (TBI) images. We observe
the TBI image segmentation is a complex task due to its multiple lesion regions,
multi-modality, and lack of prior knowledge of lesions' location. The
state-of-art image segmentation algorithms often fail to find the true lesion
regions, with high false-positive rate for single lesion detection, and high

false-negative rate in multiple lesion detection. We therefore use a
semi-supervised approach based on graph cuts. We note a little user input at the
right time and right place can significantly improve the algorithm's
performance, and we adopt a

minimalist's philosophy such that out algorithm need the least amount of user's
involvement. We make it possible by using the \emph{active learning} concept. By
active learning, the algorithm sends query to user on the most important data
point. As a result, he user's response to such query will be the most
informative, therefore the number of user interaction is minimized before the
algorithm reaches certain estimation accuracy. Even better, the algorithm has
the potential of automatically classifying the unlabeled data, and put them into
the pool of user labeled data for re-learn the model parameters. This further
decrease the user involvement, without losing segmentation accuracy. We refer
the proposed algorithm as \emph{active-cut}. 

Another contribution of work is the algorithm is able to detect multiple lesion
objects. Standard graph cut and GrabCut algorithm can only detect one
object. Our active-cut algorithm can learn the model from a simple user
initialization, and find the candidate objects and submit to user for
inspection. Contrary to the standard semi-supervised segmentation method such as
GrabCut, the user is in an passive state with out method, and just choose a
'yes' or 'no' for the candidates. The active-cut algorithm will do the remaining
work including refining the candidate objects, re-learning model parameters and
re-running graph cut algorithm for a globally optimal map.

The last contribution of our work is the introduction of the spatial context
constraints by Markov random field (MRF). Besides careful definition the energy
term of the graph cut's objective function to get smooth boundary between normal
regions and lesion regions, we also define a MRF prior within the normal regions
and within lesion regions. By doing this, the label map of gray matter, white
matter and CSF in the normal regions will be piecewise constant, as well as the
edema and bleeding regions in the lesion regions. We also define the MRF on the
candidate objects submitted to the user, so the candidates will be connected
components with smooth boundary. These MRF prior reflect our prior knowledge of
the TBI images' segmentation map.

Several researchers have applied active learning to image segmentation
\cite{top2011active,iglesias2011combining,veeraraghavan2011active}.
Veeraraghavan et al.\cite{veeraraghavan2011active} proposed an algorithm in
which segmentation is performed by grow cut and uncertainty of segmentation is
estimated by SVM to give suggestion to user. The drawbacks of this method are:
the segmentation and uncertainty estimation are separated, the algorithm is for
single object segmentation, and the suggestion for user are pixels which are not
informative and not compact.  We propose a new objective function for both graph
cuts segmentation and uncertainty estimation for active learning which naturally
put both components into one unified framework.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We apply our analysis to multimodal image data of five TBI patients with large lesions.  Each subject was scanned at two time points, an acute scan at $\approx$ 5 days and
another chronic scan at $\approx$ 6 months post injury.
The image data of each subject include T1, T2, FLAIR, and GRE modalities.
Fig.~\ref{fig:FiveSubjectsT1} illustrates T1 images of five subjects at the acute stage.
