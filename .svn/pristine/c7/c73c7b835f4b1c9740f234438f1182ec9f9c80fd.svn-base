algorithm passively wait for user to refine the segmentation map. This is
difficult in 3D space. In our method, we use the active learning techniques such
that the algorithm actively selects the candidate regions for querying the user,
and hence obtains the most informative user feedback. The active learning also
releases the user's burden since the user simply answers `yes' or `no' to a
candidate object instead of refining the map slice by slice. Our method is able
to detect multiple lesion regions. By using Markov random field, we can obtain
smooth segmentation maps as well as submit a spatially-coherent object for
querying users. The statistical inference problem is solved by graph cuts and
variational inference methods. The results show significant performance gain
with a few user involvement.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% This paragraph need revision.
Graph cuts based user-interactive image segmentation methods have been
successfully applied to computer vision, computer graphics, and medical imaging
fields \cite{boykov2001fast,rother2004grabcut}. For some complex images, a
standalone computer algorithm can not achieve good segmentation without a human
expert's involvemnet. GrabCut method [reference] is a powerful tool for
integrating human experts' knowledge and the computer algorithm's power. In
GrabCut, one typically gives an initial guess of the region of interest, for
example a bounding box. The algorithm estimates an globally optimal boundary
between the foreground and background regions. The user then inspects the
segmentation results, and adjust the boundary by drawing a region as a hard
constraint. Such process works well on two dimensional natural images, as human
being can usually quickly find the incorrectly classified regions. However, the
process will be a significant burden in 3D volume image since the user has to
visually inspect each slice and correct it.

% issues of grabcuts, 2d->3d, passive-->active.
One reason of such a burdening interaction process is the process is entirely
based on user's active inspection and correction. The algorithm is in a
\emph{passive learning} state, taking whatever the user gives as
input. Therefore, the user has to take the responsibility of looking for
possible multiple objects, and the GrabCut algorithm refines the boundaries of
the candidate objects. This passive learning process is the bottle network of
the GrabCut algorithm when applied in 3D data.

% existing algorithm's issue: large false positive.

% Motivate our methods. active learning, multiple objects, MRF prior, query
% score, low false positive, low user interaction workload. Global optimum
% (graphcuts).

In this work we propose a new method that uses active learning technique for
interactive segmentation of the Traumatic brain injury (TBI) images. We observe
the TBI image segmentation is a complex task due to its multiple lesion regions,
multi-modality, and lack of prior knowledge of lesions' location. The
state-of-art image segmentation algorithms often fail to find the true lesion
regions, with high false-positive rate for single lesion detection, and high
% why semi-supervised approach is necessary.
false-negative rate in multiple lesion detection. We therefore use a
semi-supervised approach based on graph cuts. We note a little user input at the
right time and right place can significantly improve the algorithm's
performance, and we adopt a
% hmm here may need revision.
minimalist's philosophy such that out algorithm need the least amount of user's
involvement. We make it possible by using the \emph{active learning} concept. By
active learning, the algorithm sends query to user on the most important data
point. As a result, he user's response to such query will be the most
informative, therefore the number of user interaction is minimized before the
algorithm reaches certain estimation accuracy. Even better, the algorithm has
the potential of automatically classifying the unlabeled data, and put them into
the pool of user labeled data for re-learn the model parameters. This further
decrease the user involvement, without losing segmentation accuracy. We refer
the proposed algorithm as \emph{active-cut}.

Another contribution of work is the algorithm is able to detect multiple lesion
objects. Standard graph cut and GrabCut algorithm can only detect one
object. Our active-cut algorithm can learn the model from a simple user
initialization, and find the candidate objects and submit to user for
inspection. Contrary to the standard semi-supervised segmentation method such as
GrabCut, the user is in an passive state with out method, and just choose a
`yes' or `no' for the candidates. The active-cut algorithm will do the remaining
work including refining the candidate objects, re-learning model parameters and
re-running graph cut algorithm for a globally optimal map.

The last contribution of our work is the introduction of the spatial context
constraints by Markov random field (MRF). Besides careful definition the energy
term of the graph cut's objective function to get smooth boundary between normal
regions and lesion regions, we also define a MRF prior within the normal regions
and within lesion regions. By doing this, the label map of gray matter, white
matter and CSF in the normal regions will be piecewise constant, as well as the
edema and bleeding regions in the lesion regions. We also define the MRF on the
candidate objects submitted to the user, so the candidates will be connected
components with smooth boundary. These MRF prior reflect our prior knowledge of
the TBI images' segmentation map.

% Need to beiefly talk about registration.

% some related work. and compare them with ours, to show ours is better!
Several researchers have applied active learning to image segmentation
\cite{top2011active,iglesias2011combining,veeraraghavan2011active}.
Veeraraghavan et al.\cite{veeraraghavan2011active} proposed an algorithm in
which segmentation is performed by grow cut and uncertainty of segmentation is
estimated by SVM to give suggestion to user. The drawbacks of this method are:
the segmentation and uncertainty estimation are separated, the algorithm is for
single object segmentation, and the suggestion for user are pixels which are not
informative and not compact.  We propose a new objective function for both graph
cuts segmentation and uncertainty estimation for active learning which naturally
put both components into one unified framework.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

The following is an overview of the pipeline of the proposed algorithm.

\subsection{Image segmentation by GrabCut}
Following GrabCut [reference], we build two mixture of Gaussian model for the
normal brain regions and the lesion regions. We use the expectation maximization
(EM) method to estimate both the class labels and the model parameters
$\theta$. In the graph cut step, the algorithm takes model parameters as input,
and estimates a hard label $\alpha \in \{0, 1\}$ representing if each voxel $n$
is normal ($\alpha_n =0 $) or lesions ($\alpha_n = 1$). We are different from
GrabCuts in that besides the smoothness constraint on the normal and lesion
regions' boundary, we also apply Markov random field (MRF) constraints on the
label map within normal and lesions. This soft constraint guarantee the
estimated labels is smooth.

\noindent \textbf{GrabCut with MRF}: Define the label map $\mat z = \{\vec z_1,
\dots, \vec z_N\}$, where $\vec z_n$ is a K dimension binary random variable for
voxel $n$ such that $\sum_k z_{nk} = 1$. A particular element $z_{nk} = 1$
indicates voxel $n$ is in Gaussian component $k$. The prior distribution of
$\mat z$ takes into account both the information from the brain atlas and the
spatial context constraints of MRF, and is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  p(\mat z) = \frac{1}{C} \exp\left ( \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K z_{nk} \log \pi_{nk} + \beta \sum_{(n,m)} \langle \vec z_n, \vec z_m \rangle\right ),
\end{equation*}
where the $\pi_{nk}$ is the atlas prior probability of voxel $n$ being in class
$k$, $(n, m)$ is pair of neighboring voxels, and $\langle, \rangle$ is the inner
product of two vectors, representing our preference of piecewise constant label
map, with the constraint strength given by $\beta$. Given $z_n$, the likelihood
function is defined as multivariate Gaussian $p(\vec x_n | \vec z_n) =
\mathcal{N}(\vec x_n; \theta(z_n))$, with $\vec x_n$ the observed data vector of
the multi-modality images at $n$. In EM, one need to evaluate
$\mathbb{E}_{P(\mat z |\mat x)} [\log p(\mat x, \mat z)]$, which is intractable
due to the MRF prior on $\mat z$. In this work we use the variational inference
method that iteratively updates $p(\vec z_n|\vec z_{\mathcal{N}(n)}, \vec x_n)$
given the expected value of $\vec z_n$'s neighbors $\mathcal{N}(n)$. The update
equation takes the form
\begin{equation*}
  \log p(z_{nk}) = z_{nk} \pi_{nk} + \sum_{m\in \mathcal{N}(n)} \langle \overline {\vec z}_m, \vec z_n \rangle + \log \mathcal{N} (\vec x_n; \theta(\vec z_n)),
\end{equation*}
where $\overline {\vec z}_m$ is the expected value of neighbor voxel $m$. We
compute $\log p(z_{nk})$ for all $k$ and compute $p(\vec z_n)$ by taking
exponential and normalize. $\overline{z}_n$ is just $p(\vec z_n)$ for binary
variables and will be used for updating $\vec z_n$'s neighbors. The variational procedure stops when no $\vec z_n$ changes.

\noindent \textbf{GrabCuts global optimization: } We define the objective
function of GrabCuts optimization as
\begin{align*}
  &\mat E(\alpha) = \gamma \sum_{(m,n)} \psi(\alpha_n, \alpha_m) \exp \left ( -\beta_0 \| \vec x_n - \vec x_m\|^2 \right ) +\\
  & \sum_n^N \mathbb{E}_{p(\mat z|\mat x)} \log p(\vec x_n, \vec z_n; \theta (\alpha)),
  %% &\mathbb{E}_{p(\mat z|\mat x)} \log p(\vec x, \vec z; \theta (\alpha_n)) = \!\!\sum_{k=1}^K \!z_{nk}(\log \pi_{nk} \!+\! \log \mathcal{N}(\vec x_n; \theta(\alpha_n))) \!+\!  \beta \!\!\!\!\!\!\sum_{m \in \mathcal{N}(n)} \!\!\!\!\!\langle \vec z_n, \!\vec z_m\rangle \!-\! \log C \!\!\!\!,
\end{align*}
where $\psi = 1$ if $\alpha_n \neq \alpha_m$, otherwise $\psi = 0$. The
smoothness constraint depends on the data term, so it is a conditional random
field. When building the graph, we set the T-link by the second term, and the
N-link by the first term in the above equation. Given the first initialization
of a bounding box by the user. we initialize the $\alpha$ map such that $\alpha
= 1$ (lesion) within the bounding box, and $\alpha = 0$ outside. The GrabCut
algorithm keeps outside voxels' $\alpha$ fixed, and update the $\alpha$ of
voxels within bounding box. Such strategy guarantees low false positive
detection. The possible lesion objects outside of the bounding box will be
detected in the following active learning algorithm.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Active Learning New Lesion Object}

% Gives a short intro of active learning with (just one) reference. Why active
% learning, benefit. How that works in general. Then talk about our
% strategy. Need to mention self-training (automatically add unlabeled data into
% labeled dataset, thus decreasing user interaction/burden).
Once the EM and graph-cut converges, the algorithm enters into the
active-learning step. In the graph-cut, we do not move the noxel in normal
region into the lesions in order to control the false positive detection. In
this learning step, the algorithm automatically computes the probability of each
voxel in the normal region belonging to the lesions. It then builds a connected
component map, since such a high-level object-based representation is convenient
for user interaction. We sort the multiple objects in a decending order of the
probability of being in the lesion regions, and submit the top object for user
to query. Even better, when the algorithm believes the top object should be in
the lesion with sufficient confidence, it adds the object into lesion in a
self-training process without querying users, hence further reducing the user
involvement.

% How the query score are computed. (LW will add stuff here)
\noindent\textbf{Query Score: }The log-odds of $\alpha$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
  a = \log p(\alpha=1) + \mathbb{E}_{p(\vec z_n|\vec x_n)} \log p(\vec x_n, \vec z_n; \theta (\alpha=1))\\
  - \log p(\alpha=0) + \mathbb{E}_{p(\vec z_n|\vec x_n)} \log p(\vec x_n, \vec z_n; \theta (\alpha=0)),
\end{align*}
where the $p(\alpha)$ is assumed to be a MRF. The predictive probability of a
voxel being in lesion can be computed by the standard logistic function
$p(\alpha_n=1|\vec x_n) = 1/ (1 + \exp (-a))$. We obtain a binary map $\vec w$
by thresholding the predictive map at 0.5, and identify a series of objects
$R_i$ by running a connected component routine on $\vec w$. To further select
the most salient objects, we sort the objects in decending order of the
following score:
\begin{align}
q(R_i) = \sum_{n\in R_i} p(\alpha = 1| \vec x_n) / \vert\{n: n\in \mathcal{B}(R_i) \}\vert
\end{align}
The $\mathcal{B}(R)$ is the set of voxels on the boundary of $R$, and the
denominator denotes the number of voxels on the bondary of $R_i$. The above
query score prefers objects with larger volumes of posterior probability. The
score also prefers blob-like objects since such object has large volume-surface
ratio. Such criteria reflects our prior knowledge on the lesion object's shape.

\subsection{4D modeling Pathological Anatomy}

% partially initialized lesion region/objects can be recovered later by
% self-training/act-learning. Need to show that!
% Using the likelihood estimated using acCut for 4D modeling pathological
% anatomy which follows the MBIA paper.
In order to estimate deformations from a healthy template to each time point and
evaluate mapping between time points, the result of active learning based Graph
cuts, likelihood, is used for modeling pathological anatomy.  This follows the
4D pathological anatomy modeling framework of Wang et al. \cite{WangMBIA2013}.
The estimated likelihood, $p( I_{t}(x) | c, \theta_t^c )$, can be plugged into the data functional $\mathcal{F}(A, \phi_t, Q_t) = $
\begin{equation}
- \sum_{t=1}^T \, \sum_{x=1}^N \, \log \, ( \, \sum_{c=1}^C P_t^{c}(x) \, p( I_{t}(x) | c, \theta_t^c ) \, )
\end{equation}
where the spatial prior $P_t^c$ for each class $c$ at time point $t$ is defined as,
\begin{equation}
P_t^c = A^c \circ \phi_t + Q_t^c,
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the tissue class probability that is initially associated with the
healthy template, $\phi_t$ is the diffeomorphic deformation from time $t$ to the
atlas, and $Q_t$ is the non-diffeomorphic probabilistic change for time $t$.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We apply our analysis to multi-modality image data of four TBI patients with
large lesions.  Each subject was scanned at two time points, an acute scan at
$\approx$ 5 days and another chronic scan at $\approx$ 6 months post injury.
The image data of each subject include T1, T2, FLAIR, and GRE modalities.
% need to say: the number of components of the Gaussian mixture model is set to
% 3 for normal region (GM, WM, CSF) and 2 for lesion area (edema, bleeding) to
% reflect our prior knowledge.

The forth iteration is not shown because user chose 'stop' to stop the active learning.}
\label{fig:userinter}
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig:userinter} shows the iterative active learning based user
interaction of subject I.
We see that in the first iteration the hard constraint is just the bounding box of user input and therefore the foreground alpha map is restricted in the bounding box. Because we enforce the MRF prior on alpha map between foreground and background, it ensures the smoothness of the segmentation of foreground and background. In the second iteration, since user accepted one candidate patch, and then the hard constraint was updated accordingly. We see this user-accepted patch is actually connected to the bounding box. This is one advantage of our algorithm which doesn't require user to give perfect bounding box for lesions. This is a good feature because in practice it's extremely difficult and time-consuming to ask user to give a good 3D bounding box to include one major lesion area. In the third iteration, user rejected one candidate patch and accepted a second one. The user-accepted patch is not connected to the major lesion but our algorithm is still able to capture it, this is another advantage of our algorithm. Not like regular GrabCut, it's designed for single object segmentation. Our algorithm is able to segment multiple objects and actively provide user candidate patches which makes the user interaction more efficiently. 
Another advantage of our algorithm is that by combing volume, predictive probability, and shape information, most of the top-ranked patches are actually true candidates. This further makes the user interaction efficiently since if many top-ranked patches are wrong candidates, user will have to reject many patches to be able to get good segmentation. 
During the iterations of user interaction, every user accepted or rejected candidate patch is recorded and then used as mask in the following iterations to avoid to recommend the same patch to users.

\section{Conclusions}
We presented a semi-supervised method for modeling longitudinal
MR images of severe TBI patients with multiple lesion regions. 
The major component of our algorithm is active learning based segmentation which allows
efficient user interaction. Compare to standard GrabCut, our method has several advantages. 
First, instead of passively waiting user to discover the missing segmentation area, 
our method actively recommend coherent patch to users to decide if it is true candidate. 
Second, our algorithm is able to capture multiple objects which is common is severe TBI case 
but the standard GrabCut is designed for single object.
By taking the rough bounding box into account, integrating different features of candidate patch, and keeping track of the user interaction, our algorithm is able to make the user interaction easy, robust and efficiently to segment multiple lesions.
We also used MRF to enforce the smoothness of FG/BG segmentation and the provide user spatially-coherent object for query. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our method is able to improve segmentation significantly and therefore improve the following 4D modeling. 
In the future, we'd like to validate our method using a large data set.
