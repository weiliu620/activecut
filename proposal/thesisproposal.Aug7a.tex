\section{Introduction}
The human brain consists of a complicated structural network which supports and
modulates the functional connectivity. Identifying the structural and functional
connectivity helps the understanding of the brain's functional architecture and
the link between the mind and the brain. Among the various non-invasive
techniques of probing the neuro-anatomical connectivity, resting-state
functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has gained increasing interest. The blood oxygenation
level-dependent (BOLD) signal of fMRI detects the locations of increased neuro
activity by measuring the blood oxygen levels at consecutive time points. The
connectivity is typically measured by temporal correlation between spatially
distant regions.

In conventional functional connectivity study, the spatial patterns of
connectivity is enforced by applying a smoothing filter as a preprocessing
step. Depending on the noise level and the number of subjects in a group study,
optimal kernel width of the filter may vary~\cite{mikl2008effects}. However, in
current state-of-art processing pipeline, the kernel size is empirically given
from 4mm to 10mm. This may introduce over-smoothing and pose difficulty of
identifying connectivity between small regions, or less-smoothing resulting in
insufficient noise reduction and less optimal detection. It is therefore in need
of a method that explicitly models the spatial smoothness of the connectivity
patterns. The model should be data-driven in that the parameters are estimated
from the fMRI images understudy.

The accurate delineation of function connectivity with rs-fMRI relies on the
ability to study group of subjects. Due to physiological noise and the random
thoughts during the data acquisition, subjects exhibit similar but not exactly
same spontaneous BOLD fluctuation. Most study first identify each subject's
connectivity separately regardless of other subjects, then estimate a
\emph{pooled} summary of the group connectivity map. From a Bayesian statistics
point of view, such approaches are sub-optimal, since estimation of one
subject's connectivity can benefit from other subjects. We need a data-driven,
unified probabilistic framework for the inference from the posterior of
connectivity variables of both group and subjects, given the observed time
series data.

\section{Problem Statement}

%% \begin{center}
%% \parbox{5in}{\emph{The goal of my research is to identify the functional
%%     connectivity of the human brain cortex by using resting-state fMRI. I build

\end{center}

\noindent The phrase \emph{Context} has two meanings: 1) The functional patterns
of human brain is spatially coherent. Neighboring voxels have larger probability
of being in the same functional network. 2) The network that a voxel belongs to
in one subjects is dependant on the networks of the same voxels in other
subjects. The patterns of functional networks from rs-fMRI study are to some
extent shared by multiple subjects, while the variability across subjects must
be taken into account.

By \emph{consistency} I mean the noise and individual variability of each
subject's connectivity is mitigated to the extent that is estimated from the
data.

\section{Contributions}
To test our statement, we propose the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Full Pairwise Connectivity With Spatial Coherence.} I aim to
    propose a method that estimates pairwise functional connectivity in the
    whole brain of a single subject, without \emph{a priori} knowledge of the
    seed region. The model need to take into account the spatial context
    information, and learn the coherence from the data.

  \item \textbf{Identify Consistent, Spatially Coherent Multiple Functional
    Networks.} I aim to propose data-driven, parametric model that can cluster
    the gray matter of single subject's brain into multiple functional networks,
    while respecting the spatial coherence of the voxels.

  \item \textbf{Hierarchical Model For Group Study.} I aim to propose a
    hierarchical model that can estimate functional networks from a group of
    subjects. The model will estimate group's network map as well as individual
    subjects at the same time. When Clustering the voxels into different
    networks, both spatial neighbors within subjects and cross subjects will be
    used as prior in a Bayesian framework.
  \item \textbf{A Hierarchical Probabilistic Model For Inference From Posterior
    Density of connectivity variables. } Based on the hierarchical MRF model we
    proposed above, we can draw inference of the variance and the confidence
    interval of the functional network. I also aim to study the variability of
    the spatial patterns based on the posterior density, and across
    subjects. This can be done, for example, by sampling from the posterior, and
    do an eigen analysis to get the principal mode of change of the spatial
    patterns.

\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}

There are two fundamental principles in probing brain's functional organization:
\emph{functional integration} and \emph{functional
  specialization}~\cite{friston2007statistical}. Functional specialization means
an anatomically segregated cortex region is specialized for some aspects of a
mental process. A cortical infrastructure that support such process may involve
many specialized areas. Functional integration says these areas do not exist in
isolation, but are mediated by the information flows via the action potentials
carried by axons, which are bundled into large fiber tracts.

fMRI is originally used for detect the neuro activity in experiments with task
paradigm. It was found \cite{raichle2001} that there are consistent patterns of
activity even at subject's resting state, when subjects do not receive any
external stimulus during scan. In recent years the emphasis of neuroimaging is
shifting from blobology (functional specialization/segregation) towards
connectology (functional integration)\cite{Smith20121257}, such spontaneous
activity estimated from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) have provide insight into
the intrinsic architecture of the human brain. 

The Majority of functional neuroscience studies has a task or stimulus for the
subject to conduct, and the resulting changes in neuro activity are
measured. For data obtained in such experiments, the core methods such as
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) use General Linear
Model~\cite{worsley_analysis_1995} to test a null hypothesis, hence a hypothesis
driven method. The effects of a stimulus signal is estimated as a multiple
linear regression problem, with BOLD signal of stimulus as predictor variable,
and BOLD signal of any brain voxel as response variables. Activation or no
activation is decided by the significance of the effects (i.e. regression
coefficients) under the null hypothesis of no activation. This method is often
regarded as mass univariate, in the sense that the effects of the stimulus on
one voxel is independent on the effect of others, even they are spatially
adjacent. In practice, a Gaussian filter is always applied for spatial smoothing
in preprocessing step, and introduces dependence between spatially adjacent
voxels' intensities (and also the effects of SPM).

In rs-fMRI study, the aim is to look for spontaneous neuro activity when there
is no external input.Because of the lack of stimulus signal, the standard SPM
method does not apply to the rs-fMRI data. New computational methods, sometimes
called data-driven analysis, borrow technical concepts from many fields
including machine learning and computer vision. These methods fall into a few
categories~\cite{margulies2010resting} listed as below.

Seed-based methods look for the linear correlation between an \emph{a priori}
region-of-interest (ROI) and all other regions or voxels in the whole
brain~\cite{fox2005human}. This approach is inherent simple, sensible, and easy
to interpret. However, a \emph{a priori} manual selection of ROI is required,
and only one functional system can be detected at a time. In section
\ref{sec:highmrf} we propose a mixture model for connectivity analysis without
the seed region as input~\cite{liu2010spatial}. This is to our knowledge the first
work that can estimate all spatially coherent, pairwise connections in a single
run.

\begin{SCfigure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/6dmrf}
  \caption{A MRF defined on high dimensional graph that model the pairwise
  connections of gray matter voxels. A node in the high dimension graph is
  defined as a pair of voxels in original image. an edge are added when any
  voxels in the two pair of voxels are spatially neighbors. This MRF is embedded
  into a generative model as a prior distribution, i.e. we suppose , a sample
  correlation is \emph{generated} from the given random variable of connectivity
  or no connectivity. For inference of the connectivity given the observed
  sample correlation data, \emph{Maximum a Posteriori} is used, together with
  the Gibbs Sampling and mean field theory approximation. }
  \label{fig:6dmrf}
\end{SCfigure}


Independent Component analysis (ICA) methods look for statistically independent
components without the need of selecting ROI~\cite{calhoun2001spatial}. But
users need to manually select meaningful component by visual
inspection. Clustering-based methods partition the brain voxels into distinct
regions (clusters), and voxels in same regions belong to same functional
networks. If the goal is to discriminate the patients and healthy control
groups, pattern classification method can also be used.

There are also graph theory based methods that treats each ROI (or voxel) as a
node on the graph, and the connectivity between them as edges, and a rich set of
graph algorithms can be used to learn the graph structure (small-worldness,
modularity, etc). 


\section{Methodology and Preliminary work} 
The main technical tool used in our series of work is generative probabilistic
model and Markov Random Field (MRF). The statistical dependency between
spatially adjacent voxels is represented by a clique potential function in
MRF. To be specific, define a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$,
where $V$ is the set of nodes, with each node representing a single voxel in the
image.  An edge $e=(s,r)$ is added to $\mathcal{E}$ if the node $s$ and $r$ are
spatial neighbors. The functional network that a voxel belongs to is defined by
the random variable $y_s \in \mathcal{L} = \{1,\dots, L\}$ defined on each node $s\in \mathcal{V}$.
\subsection{Full Pairwise Connectivity With Spatial Coherence}\label{sec:highmrf}
Our first attempt~\cite{liu2010spatial} on detecting functional network aims to
explicitly model the spatial smoothness of the network. In both task-based and
resting-state fMRI the impact of imaging noise can be reduced by taking
advantage of the spatial correlations between neighboring voxels in the image. A
common approach used for instance in Statistical Parametric Mapping
(SPM)\cite{worsley_analysis_1995} is to apply a spatial Gaussian filter to
smooth the signal prior to statistical analysis. However, this can lead to
overly blurred results, where effects with small spatial extent can be lost and
detected regions may extend beyond their actual boundaries. An alternative
approach to spatial regularization that has been proposed for task activation
paradigms is to use a Markov Random Field (MRF)
prior~\cite{ou_spatial_2005,descombes_spatio-temporal_1998,descombes_fmri_1998,woolrich_fully_2004,cosman_exact_2004},
which models the conditional dependence of the signals in neighboring voxels.

We propose~\cite{liu2010spatial} to use MRF models in rs-fMRI to leverage spatial
correlations in functional connectivity maps. Unlike previous MRF-based
approaches, which use the neighborhood structure defined by the original image
voxel grid, the neighborhoods in functional connectivity must take into account
the possible relationships between spatially distant voxels. Therefore, we
define the neighborhood graph on the set of all voxel pairs. This results in a
Markov structure on a grid with twice the dimensions of the original image data,
i.e., the pairwise connectivities for three-dimensional images results in a
six-dimensional MRF. The neighborhood structure is defined so that two voxels
are more likely to be connected if they are connected to each other's spatial
neighbors. See figure \ref{fig:6dmrf} for a illustrative view.


We combine the Markov prior on functional connectivity maps with a likelihood
model of the time series correlations in a posterior estimation problem.
Furthermore, we model solve for the unknown parameters of the MRF and likelihood
using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the estimation step the
posterior random field is sampled using Gibbs Sampling and estimated using Mean
Field theory.

Fig.~\ref{fig:mrfvssmoothing} compares the real data results using no spatial
regularization, Gaussian smoothing, and the proposed MRF model. Though the
posterior connectivity of the MRF is computed between every pair of voxels
within a slice, for visualization purposes, only the posterior of the
connectivity between one voxel and the slice is shown. We chose to visualize the
connectivity to a voxel in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) because this is
known to be involved in the Default Mode Network~\cite{raichle2001}, with
connections to the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). The results show that
Gaussian smoothing is able to remove noise, but is unable to find a clear
connection between the PCC and the MPFC. Our proposed MRF model (rightmost plot)
is able to remove spurious connections, and also clearly shows a connection to
the MPFC.

It is noted that this approach does not need \emph{a priori} knowledge of the
ROI. Once the algorithm finishes, it outputs all the pairwise connectivity for
all gray matter voxels. Putting this large connectivity matrix into a
visualization tool, users can explore the functional networks with various seed
regions and see the real-time results.

\subsection{Identify Consistent, Spatially Coherent Multiple Functional Networks}

The above method in section \ref{sec:highmrf} is able to detect functional
networks such as default mode network, there are two issues that have to be
addressed. 1) With one seed region at a time, only one functional system can be
shown. The functional architecture would be better understood if multiple
systems are shown together in the same image. 2) The computation cost is huge,
mostly due to the high dimensional graph and the optimization problem.  This is
partly mitigated by a GPU implementation in current single subject analysis, but
would be difficult for generalizing to group study.

One possible solution is to employ clustering techniques to automatically
partition the brain into functional networks. In such methods, a similarity
metric is defined first, e.g., correlation \cite{5074650} or frequency coherence
\cite{thirion2006detection}, and then a clustering method such as $k$-means or
spectral clustering is used to group voxels with similar time series. A drawback
of these approaches is that they disregard the spatial position of voxels, and
thus ignore the fact that functional networks are organized into sets of
spatially coherent regions.

We introduce a new data-driven method~\cite{liu2011monte} to partition the brain
into spatial coherent, non-overlapping networks of functionally-related regions
from rs-fMRI. The proposed algorithm does not require specification of a seed,
and there is no ad hoc thresholding or parameter selection. We make a natural
assumption that functionally homogeneous regions should be spatially
coherent. Our method incorporates spatial information through a Markov random
field (MRF) prior on voxel labels, which models the tendency of spatially-nearby
voxels to be within the same functional network.

We notice the mean intensity and the variance (both over all the time points) of
the time course at each voxel is not a indicator whether they belong to same
functional network, so each time series is first normalized to zero mean and unit
norm, which results in data lying on a high-dimensional unit sphere. We then
model the normalized time-series data as a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF)
distributions \cite{banerjee2006clustering}. Each component of the mixture model
corresponds to the distribution of time series from one functional network.

Solving for the parameters in this combinatorial model is intractable, and we
therefore use a stochastic method called Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization
(MCEM), which approximates the expectation step using Monte Carlo
integration. The stochastic property of MCEM makes it possible to explore a
large solution space, and it performs better than a standard mode approximation
method using iterated conditional modes (ICM).

The proposed method is related to previous approaches using MRFs to model
spatial relationships in fMRI data. Descombes et
al.~\cite{descombes_spatio-temporal_1998} use a spatio-temporal MRF to analyze
task-activation fMRI data. Our previous methods~\cite{liu2010spatial} use an MRF
model of rs-fMRI to estimate pairwise voxel connections. However, neither of
these approaches tackle the problem of clustering resting-state fMRI into
functional networks.

The linear correlation between two time series in original image space is
equivalent to the inner product of two points on the sphere.  MRF is again used
as a spatial smoothness prior on the hidden network labels. We estimate the
network labels by maximizing its posterior probability in a EM framework, such
that voxels with same estimated labels have larger inner product, which amounts
to have larger correlation in original space and belong to same functional
network. The introduction of MRF again poses the difficulty of computing the
expectation directly, We use Monte-Carlo Sampling to approximate the expectation
value in EM. By this method~\cite{liu2011monte} we are able to detect most
significant brain networks like motor, visual, motion, salience and executive
control, and default mode network with precision and consistency competitive to
standard ICA method, as can be found in figure \ref{fig:wholebrain}.

\subsection{Current Work: Hierarchical Model For Group Study} \label{sec:hier}

The availability of large rs-fMRI databases opens the door for systematic group
studies of functional connectivity. It is a natural assumption that a group of
subjects must share similar patterns of functional connectivity, while keeping
individual subject's variability. Such variability may come from subject random
thoughts, despite that they are instructed not to think anything
specifically. While the inherently high level of noise in fMRI makes functional
network estimation difficult at the individual level, combining many subjects'
data together and jointly estimating the common functional networks is more
robust. However, this approach does not produce estimates of individual
functional connectivity. Such individual estimates are an important step in
understanding functional networks not just on average, but also how these
networks vary across individuals.

The method we propose in above section \cite{liu2011monte} works specifically on
single subject analysis, and my next aim is to build a model that estimate
functional networks among a group of subjects.  Most current studies estimate
the networks in a sequential approach, i.e., they identify each individual
subject's network independently to other subjects, and then estimate the group
network from the subjects networks. This one-way flow of information prevents
one subject's network estimation benefiting from other subjects.

Group ICA \cite{calhoun2001spatial} is a generalization of ICA to multiple
subjects, in which all subjects are assumed to share a common spatial component
map but have distinct time courses. The time courses from all subjects are
concatenated temporally, followed by a single ICA. Although the subject
component maps are obtained by a back-reconstruction procedure, there is no
explicit statistical modeling of the variability between the group and subject
component maps.  Ng et. al \cite{nggroup2012} use group replicator dynamics (RD)
to detect subject's sparse component maps, with group information integrated
into each subject's RD process. In clustering-based methods, the subjects
clusterings are usually averaged to obtain a group affinity matrix and are
followed by a second level clustering on the group similarity matrix
\cite{bellec2010multi,van2008normalized}. Because the group level clustering is
conducted after subject level clustering, the clustering of one subject is
unaware of the information from other subjects, as well as the group clustering.

\vspace*{-8pt}
\end{figure}

We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model~\cite{Liu2012a} to identify the
functional networks from rs-fMRI that includes both subject and population
levels. We assume a group network label map that acts as a prior to the label
maps for all subjects in the population. This Bayesian perspective provides a
natural regularization of the estimation problem of a single subject using
information from the entire population. The variability between the subjects and
group are taken into account through the conditional distributions between group
and subjects. The within-subject spatial coherence is again modeled by a
MRF. The group and all subjects network map are connected into a larger graph,
with edges between corresponding voxels between group and subjects, and between
adjacent voxels within single subjects.

The concept of this hierarchical model is similar to the multi-level modeling of
linear regression. Estimation of the functional network on single
subject corresponds to no pooling since it fits a model for each subject
separately. A sequential approach to estimate group network after subjects
networks is like complete pooling, since it ignores the group information when
estimating subjects network. And the hierarchical model corresponds to the
partial pooling, i.e., the multi-level model where a tradeoff defined by a
pooling factor, or a shrinkage factor. Compared to the \emph{pooled} averaging
method, our hierarchical model respects the individual variablity, hence also
better estimates the group's functional network.

Both the group clustering and subject clusterings are estimated simultaneously
with a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm.  The model is
data-driven in that all parameters, regularized by two given hyper-parameters,
are estimated from the data, and the only parameter that must be specified is
the number of networks.

ours is the first hierarchical MRF applied to fMRI for modeling both
group and individual networks. The model of Ng et al. \cite{ng2010group}
combines all subjects into a single MRF and bypasses the need for one-to-one
voxel correspondence across subjects, but the edges are added directly between
subjects without a group layer. In our model, a group layer network map is
explicitly defined, and the consistency between subjects is encoded through
adding edges between group and subjects labels. Our method differs from other
clustering methods \cite{bellec2010multi,van2008normalized} in that their
methods identify the subject's functional network patterns independently,
without any knowledge of other subjects or group population. Instead, our method
estimates both levels of network patterns simultaneously.  The proposed approach
can be seen as a counterpart on the clustering branch of the multi-subject
dictionary learning algorithm \cite{varoquaux2011multi}, which also has a
hierarchical model and a spatially smoothed sparsity prior on the group
component map.

\section{Future work and Timeline} 

In he following year I will continue to polish the hierarchical model that we proposed in section \ref{sec:hier}. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Fall 2012:} Submit a journal paper on the hierarchical model in section \ref{sec:hier}. This includes the following works:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item [1.] Currently our model has a parameter that controls how much the
        subject function network maps should \emph{shrink} towards the group
        network map. I aim to find some guidance of how to set the parameter
        value based on either the data itself or some physiology knowledge.
        
      \item [2.] Convergence test. The inference if posterior from the
        hierarchical model that we proposed in \cite{Liu2012a} pose a difficult
        optimization problem, and a Markov Chian Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is
        used to obtain approximate solution. In general Markov Chain sampling,
        some convergence tests are available \cite{cowles1996markov} as guidance
        of when to stop the chain. However, since MCMC on MRF is a multivariate
        problem, it is difficult to have a stopping rule to guarantee that the
        number of iterations is sufficient. 

        My aim is to find a method that can give a bound of the required
        iterations before the samples are from the stationary distribution. One
        method is the coupling technique
        \cite{haggstrom1999exact,propp1996exact}, where two or more parallel
        chains are sampled based on same sequence of random number. The sampling
        procedure converges when all the parallel chains coupled, i.e. reach to
        same state.
