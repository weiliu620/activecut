- Need a func to write patch data back into file, to verify the averaging routine works. Done!
- have a smoothness constraint on the gmm, too. (MRF? and ICM)
- have a parameter for the number of neighbors. Now it seems 6 neithbors give square shapes of the region.  Done!
-- optimal gamma? from user input?
-- a obj fun for both em and graphcuts? Done!
-- Re-write with lemon graph such that gmm have MRF prior. Done.
-- Study the hierarchical model that also have alpha as variable.
-- confidence of the atlas prior: dichelet?
-- write out prior to check it looks good. 
-- need a routine to convert 4d probability to 3d label map. 
-- The patches shape may have information to make decision if this is a good candidate of lesion. If it's round (small ratio of boundary/area), it's probably a good candidate.



-- write a 'maskpathces' routine take patches image and mask image as input, and output masked image. 

-- add parameter in par: 1) criteria to stop self training and start active
   learning. 2) read ret value of update_constraints func. 3) save gmm
   parameters. 3) add a flag to decide if we allow BG->FG change of alpha.

-- check priorfg doesn't work for all one images

Sep 23: in the long run, we try to not let user input a bounding box. The
initial foreground can be found by looking at the FLAIR image.

The query predictive probability's prior MRF, and the graphcuts N-Links term can
be changed: instead of using the data term in the prior, we can compute a edge
map (just like my draft slic code) by the canny operator on each channel and
average the edge map. We can define the edge based on the edge map.

Jan 22: Found the original reason of not splitting inner EM loop and outer loop:
K-Means have to be computed again at each act learning iteration.

But we can save the parameters saved by K-Means to a file, and load the
parameter files each time we run grabcuts. this way, we do not need outer
loop. Insetad we can use just the innter loop (EM), exit the c executable, and
run pythong for updating the hard constraint maps.

A small bug: after hard constraints is udpated, the first run of E step use the
outdated alpha map. This is not a big issue since the second innner loop soon
updates the alpha map to be consistent with hard consistant, by using the graph
cut method.


Jan 24: need to add a option of whether using prior maps. If yes, add more prior
maps for fg and bg. If no, no bothering adding prior maps.
