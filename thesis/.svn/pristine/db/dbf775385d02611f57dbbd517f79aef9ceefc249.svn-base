In this thesis I study the functional connectivity of the human brain by the
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The functional
MRI measures the change of oxygen consumption level in the blood vessel, hence
indirectly detects the brain's neuro activity. When there is no external
stimuli, one uses rs-fMRI to detect the brain's spontaneous activity. The study
of the intrinsic brain activity is an important step to explore human brain's
functional organization and dynamics, and to understand the difference of the
functional patterns of normal people and patients with mental disorder, such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorders.

The goal of thesis is to robust estimate the functional connectivities between
spatially remote regions or voxels in the brain's gray matter. Throughout the
thesis work, we extensively use graphical model and Markov random field (MRF) to
model the spatial correlation and the inter-subject dependency of the
connectivity or network label variables. Graphical model gives a mapping between
a multivariate distribution and a graph. The conditional independence between
variables are often what we are interested in, and can be read out by inspecting
the graph. By carefully defining the nodes and the edges with their weights on
the graph, we build the soft-constraints as the prior information into the graph
structure. By the Bayesian method, the statistical inference now becomes to
compute the posterior distribution, or its modes given the observed data, with
the prior defined by the distribution represented by the graph.

The statistical inference is a combinatorial problem when the variables defined
on the nodes are discrete. The inference of marginal distribution of nodes on
simple graph structure such as a chain or a tree can be solved exactly. For
general MRF the problem can not be solved in polynomial time. We explored
various approximated optimization methods such as variational inference, graph
cuts, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC).

We applied the random field model to three related problems. In the first
problem, the goal is to detect the pairwise connectivity between gray matter
voxels in a single subject rs-fMRI dataset. We define a six dimensional graph to
represent our prior that two voxels are more likely to be connected if their
spatial neighbors are connected. The posterior mean of the connectivity
variables are estimated by the variational inference, also known as mean field
theory in statistical physics. The method proves to outperform spatial smoothing
at detecting finer patterns of brain activity. Our second work aims to identify
multiple functional systems simultaneously. Here we define a Potts model, a
special case of MRF on the network label variables, and define von Mises-Fisher
distribution on the normalized fMRI signal. The inference is significant more
difficult than the binary classification in previous problem. We use MCMC to
draw samples from the posterior distribution of network labels. In the third
application, we extend the graph to multiple subject scenario. By building a
graph including both the population level's network map and the subjects maps,
we defined a hierarchical model which has richer structure than single subject
model, and captures the shared properties and also the variation among the
subjects. All the applications use Bayesian philosophy, and is data-driven by
estimating parameters from the data. The experiments shows that by the the
regularization of MRF, the functional network maps we estimated are more
accurate, and more consistent across sessions.
