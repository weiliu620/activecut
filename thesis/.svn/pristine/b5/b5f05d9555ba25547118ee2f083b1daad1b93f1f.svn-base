% a very high level overview.
Human brain is organized into distributed functional modules that work
independently but also interact with each other during cognitive activity. There
appears two principles of functional organization: functional integration and
functional specialization~\cite{friston2007statistical}. The functional
specialization assumes the modules that process a particular cognitive activity
can be localized to a anatomical region in the brain. In functional
specialization, one studies the relationship of specific anatomical regions and
the cognitive activity. However, the brain regions or functional modules do not
work alone. They interact with each other in a complex and dynamic
way. Functional integration focuses on such interactions.

% what will be covered in this chapter.
This chapter provides background information of the current research of the
exploration of brain's functional network using rs-fMRI. I will begin with the
relationship between brain activity and fMRI, and give the definitions of
functional connectivity and functional network. Then I will survey various
classes of methods for estimating the functional connectivity and the
networks.

\section{Resting-State Functional Network}
% the interaction: anatomical connectivity and functional connectivity. 
The interaction between various brain's functional modules can be represented by
the connectivity between anatomical regions. Two sets of MRI techniques are
widely used for mapping the \emph{in vivo} human's brain connectivity. Diffusion
MRI, or more specifically, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), as a structural
imaging technique, detects the anisotropy of the neural axons in the brain's
white matter by measuring the diffusion of water molecules. Such anisotropy is
used for identifying the anatomical connectivities between two regions in the
brain's white matter~\cite{jirsa2007handbook}. functional MRI (fMRI) imaging
instead serves to explore the functional links between two regions of interest
in brain's gray matter. The functional connections are the actual flow of
information that go through the anatomical links represented by the
DTI. Researchers have shown the correlation between the anatomical and
functional connections. Such correlation is a indication that functional
connectivity is physically constrained, and modulated by the structural
connectivity~\cite{honey2009predicting}. However functional and structural
connectivity are not exactly equal, suggesting the dynamic characteristics of
the functional patterns depending on the brain's state. The work in this thesis
is focused on the functional connectivity.

% fmri intro, BOLD, oxygen, task-based. 
The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal of fMRI detects the
locations of increased neuro activity by measuring the blood oxygen levels at
consecutive time points. the change of oxygen consumption in the blood indicates
that the corresponding regions consume more energy, and hence in a more active
neural activity compared to baseline state. Because of the resolution of fMRI is
much higher than the single cell or neuron, the BOLD signal reflects the energy
demands of neuro population that fire together with a common functional
purpose~\cite{huettel2004functional, jezzard2003functional}. Besides fMRI, other
techniques are also used for mapping brain's functions. They differ in terms of
both their temporal and spatial resolution. In general, electrophysiological
methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or the associated magnetic version
magnetoencephalography (MEG) records the neural events in real time, hence have
relatively high temporal resolution. On the other hand, fMRI and positron
emission tomography (PET) detect the change of blood flow due to neuronal
information processing, and have high spatial resolution (1-5 mm) but lower
temporal resolution because of the delayed haemodynamic changes.

% functional connectivity and functional network.
fMRI is initially discovered as a tool to map the brain's activity for subjects
under specific cognitive task. One compares the BOLD signal at a specific region
in the brain with the paradigm task signal. Because of the nature of the
haemodynamics of the blood, the paradigm task signal is the convolution of the
original paradigm function (for example a boxcar function) with the haemodynamic
response function (HRF). Later, people found that the BOLD signals can be used
not only to detect the functional patterns in stimulus-guided experiments, but
also to explore the co-activation of the brain when there is no cognitive task
on the subjects~\cite{biswal1995functional}. In such experiments, the primary
goal is to identify the functional connectivity between regions of the
brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependence of neuronal
activity patterns of spatially remote (or anatomically separated) brain
regions~\cite{friston1994functional, worsley_analysis_1995,
  friston1994analysis}. The temporal dependence is typically measured by the
linear correlation across all time points. Although the temporal correlation
within the BOLD signal of single region or voxel violates the independence
assumption of the time point samples, this temporal correlation is often safely
ignored. Alternatively, one also identify functional connectivity by
transforming the signals into frequency domain and compute the coherence of two
signals at curtain frequency band. This is equivalent to band pass filtering the
original BOLD signal and compute the linear correlation~\cite{cordes2000mapping,
  cordes2001frequencies}.


% Define a functional network. 
The pairwise correlation or coherence only measure the functional connectivity
between regions as a local measurement. As the whole brain is organized as a
complex system with many such pairwise interactions, it is of interests to find
out those regions with similar patterns of neuronal activity. A functional
network, or functional system (hereafter used interchangeably), is a collection
of separate anatomical regions that have similar patterns of activity measured
by BOLD signal. The regions within a functional system may have direct or
indirect information flow among them. Together the system serve one or more
cognitive tasks. An anatomical region may participate in different functional
system under different cognitive tasks.

%% [ Various levels. Task, resting, Cognitive disease. Mental disorder. Low
%% frequency. Correlation.
The correlated fluctuation of multiple brain regions not only happens in
stimulus-evoked experiments, but also in experiments where the participants rest
passively without any cognitive activity. Therefore, the resting-state fMRI
(rs-fMRI) becomes a powerful tool for probing such intrinsic activity in a
resting-brain~\cite{raichle2001, fox2007spontaneous}. The original name of the
rs-fMRI is not accurate, since the brain are not in a true resting state even
without any cognitive activity. The resting-brain consumes about 20 percent of
the whole body's energy, while it only have about 5 percent of the body
mass~\cite{fox2005human}. The study of the functional organization of brain
under rest provides new insights of how functional connectivity relates to the
cognitive psychology and neurodegenerative diseases.  Because the pathologic
conditions appear to be reflected by the interactions within or between the
functional system, the rs-fMRI study also holds valuable diagnostic and
prognostic information towards various neurological or psychiatric diseases
including Alzheimer's disease, depression and
schizophrenia\cite{fox2007spontaneous, greicius2007resting,
  greicius2003functional}, etc. The reason of this spontaneous activity is
largely unknown, although some reasonably postulate that it is a predictive
intrinsic response to the unknown events in the outside
environment~\cite{deco2010emerging}.

\section{Preprocessing fMRI Data}
Due to the noise and artifacts in fMRI data, multiple preprocessing steps are
typically taken before the real analysis starts. The preprocessing steps include
motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial and temporal filtering,
registration between structural images and functional images, and registration
to the standard template, removing physiological noise, etc.

Because of subject's head movement during the scan, the volumes at various time
points are usually not perfectly aligned. A rigid body registration is usually
done between the volumes at different time point, with either the first volume
or the middle volume as a reference. This is called motion correction. After
correction, the same voxel index is assumed to map to same brain structure
across all time points, although the correction is often not perfect. The motion
correction parameters of each volume are often used as independent variables for
a regression in order to remove the motion effect. The first few time point are
usually discarded in case the scanner is not in a stationary state.

Slice timing correction is needed because each slice of fMRI volume is not
scanned at the same time. Figure \ref{fig:slicetiming} shows the shifted time of
scan for different slices, and the method of interpolation.  The shifted time
will give sub-optimal experiment results during the analysis, especially for the
event-based experiments. One typically use a interpolation step to obtain a
volume in which all slices are at the same time point. Care must be taken for
the ordering of the slices as it is scanner dependent.

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/c2/slicetiming}
  \caption{Slice timing correction. The data at temporally adjacent slices are
    resampled and interpolated to obtain a data point at the same time with the
    reference slices.}
  \label{fig:slicetiming}
\end{figure}

Because of the physiological process of the BOLD signal, most of the interesting
information is concentrated at the low frequency range of the signal (0.01 --
0.1 Hz). The temporal band-pass filter is usually applied to remove the very low
frequency (below 0.01 Hz) and higher frequency (above 0.1 Hz). Also, due to the
spatial process of the fMRI data acquisition, neighboring voxels typically have
similar signal patterns. The statistical parametric mapping
method~\cite{friston2007statistical} makes use of this spatial dependency by
applying a spatial Gaussian filter, and further enforces the smoothness of the
signal on spatial domain. This filtering increases the SNR, but inevitably
discards finer patterns with size smaller than the smoothing kernel. Chapter
\ref{chap:method1} and Chapter \ref{chap:method2} will discuss more principal
methods that model this spatial dependency with no spatial smoothing, or very
small, conservative smoothing.

In order to report the experiment results in a standard way such that others can
understand, the structural images and functional images are both registered to a
standard template, such as MNI 152
template~\footnote{\url{http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009}}. The
functional images are first registered to structural images of the same subject
by a rigid body transformation. The structural images is then transformed to the
standard template by affine transformation. Because of the plasticity of the
brain anatomy, the registration of subject's structural image may need
non-linear transformation to register to the
template~\cite{jenkinson2012fsl}. After the structural images are registered to
the template, the functional images will also be brought to the template
space. The last step is the nuisance parameter regression. the nuisance
parameters include the six motion correction parameters that are estimated in
previous motion correction step, and also the mean signal of the white matter
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The motion correction parameters are taken into
account because even the fMRI data is motion corrected at the first step of
preprocessing, the motion may still have impact on the estimation of GLM model
of task-based fMRI, or the correlation for the rs-fMRI. The mean of white matter
and CSF is regressed out as they are assumed to consist of physiological
noise. Since there is no information for the physiological signal such as heart
beating and breathing, and the mean of white matter and CSF is used as
surrogates for such confounding signals.

With all the preprocessing steps above, the data is ready for analysis. It is
noted that the above preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific
experiments. For example, the slice timing shifting is not a severe issue for
rs-fMRI analysis and can be skipped. Besides, sometimes the preprocessing steps
may not have consistent impact on the fMRI processing pipeline. For example,
Zhang~\cite{zhang2009evaluation} pointed out that slice timing correction and
global intensity normalization have little consistent impact, but spatial
smoothing, temporal detrending, high-pass filtering and motion correction
significantly improves the pipeline performance across all subjects.

\section{Related Methods for Analyzing Functional Networks}
The temporal dependence of the spatial regions can be represented in multiple
ways. Depending on if one is interested in a specific region or a full brain's
functional patterns, one can choose from seed-based method or full brain
method. For the method that explore the full brain, there are methods that
define the region of interest (ROIs) and build a functional network by
estimating the edges of the graph with nodes defined by the ROIs. Also the
parcellation defines an image segmentation problem where the regions with higher
functional connectivities are grouped into a single cluster. In this section, I
will give a short survey of various methods, show their advantages and
disadvantages, and the similarities and differences with our methods.

\subsection{Seed Based Methods}
There are various ways of representations of functional networks depending on
the specific experiment goal. A straightforward yet statistically powerful
method is to compute the correlation between \emph{a priori} given seed regions
and every other regions in the brain~\cite{biswal1995functional,
  buckner2008brain, buckner2009cortical}. The correlation values are typically
Fisher transformed in order to meet the normal distribution assumption in the
following hypothesis test. Those transformed correlation values with $p$ value
less than certain threshold are regarded as the existence of the functional
connectivity. All voxels or regions that are functionally connected to the seed
regions belong to the same functional system. The seed-based methods are useful
when user asks a straightforward question, and knows what functional system is
of interest. The result is easy to interpret compared to other more complex
methods.  The advantage of seed-based methods is its simplicity and relatively
ease of extending to multiple subjects. One just computes the average
correlations across subjects for a given pair of regions. When users are
interested in the connectivity to multiple regions, they can define more than
one seed.

However, it also has the limit that the user has to know in advance the
seed. The seed as \emph{a priori} information is an advantage when it accurately
represents the functional patterns of interests. However, a functional system
can not be identified if the seed region falls out of the system.  Despite the
limit, it is used in many works, sometimes with better visualization by dynamic
moving the seed and showing the real-time functional system associated with the
current seed region~\cite{yeo2011organization}.

\subsection{ICA and Other Decomposition Methods}
Because of functional networks are in a large scale over the whole brain, and in
a distributed manner, multi-variate analysis is a better way of exploring the
full brain's functional organization. A large class of multi-variate methods use
the signal-decomposition concept from the signal processing community, and
decompose the BOLD signal at each region or voxel into various independent
components, each of which as part of one functional system. The signal and the
weight coefficients of these independent signals represent how much of the
current voxel belongs to certain functional network component. One widely
accepted method in this class is the independent component analysis (ICA). ICA
was originally introduced in signal processing field to separate various source
of signals from samples of mixed signals, and later was applied to rc-fMRI
data~\cite{nggroup2012, beckmann2005tensorial, damoiseaux2006consistent}. The
central limit theorem states the sum of two independent signals is more like
Gaussian then any of the original signals. Therefore maximizing the
non-Gaussianity gives us the original independent components. Besides the
maximization of non-Gaussianity, the independent can also be estimated by
minimization of mutual information, or by maximum
likelihood~\cite{hyvarinen2000independent}.

There are two varieties when applying to ICA to rs-fMRI dataset. Spatial ICA
assume all the voxel intensities at certain time point as one mixed signal
sample. Therefore the mixed signals are independent across all spatial
voxels. Alternatively, temporal ICA treats each BOLD time series at a voxel a
mixed signal, hence the source signals are independent across the time
point~\cite{calhoun2001spatial}. Notice the functional maps we are interested in
is the rows of source signal matrix $S$ for spatial ICA, and is the weight
coefficients matrix $\tilde A$ for temporal ICA (see Figure \ref{fig:c2ica} for
an illustration). Because of the large number of voxels compared to number of
time points, the spatial ICA is typically used for rs-fMRI analysis. Compared to
seed-based methods, ICA is purely data-driven, and can identify networks over
the whole brain, including the already well-know cognitive processing systems
such as motor~\cite{biswal1995functional},
visual~\cite{damoiseaux2006consistent}, attention~\cite{fox2006spontaneous}
executive control and salience network~\cite{seeley2007dissociable,
  seeley2009neurodegenerative}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/c2/ica}
  \caption{Spatial ICA v.s. temporal ICA for BOLD series of length $T$ at $N$
    voxels.  In spatial ICA, all the voxel intensity at a single time point is
    assumed a mixed signal of $P$ independent signals. And there are $T$ such
    mixed signals. The decomposition is in the form of $X = A\cdot S$, where A
    is the weight coefficients and each row of $S$ is the independent source
    signal.  We are interested in the $S$ since each row is regarded as a
    functional component. In temporal ICA, the BOLD time series of each voxel is
    the mixed signals, and there are $N$ such mixed signals. The decomposition
    is $\tilde X = \tilde A \cdot \tilde S$, with $\tilde A$ the weights, and
    rows in $\tilde S$ the independent signal. Here we are interested in the
    columns of $\tilde A$ as they are regarded as representations of the
    functional networks.  }
  \label{fig:c2ica}
\end{figure}

However, because ICA need to estimate both the independent components and mixing
coefficients, it is a significantly more difficult task. Before applying ICA,
the data usually need a whitening step with principal component analysis, and is
thus rotated such that it has unit variance in terms of the covariance matrix,
and greatly simplifies the ICA problem. The estimated independent components are
usually z transformed, and thresholded for visualization purpose. Because the
resting-state brain functional patterns are unpredictable, the output
independent components need to be visually inspected in order to identify
physiologically meaningful components. The iterative optimization also
introduces variability between multiple runs of ICA with different initial
state. In addition, the dimensional in the PCA preprocessing step is typically
chosen arbitrarily, adding more variation of the results. A recent test on the
reliability of ICA~\cite{zuo2010reliable} shows how the choice of the dimension
and the number of components have impact on the consistency of the results.

\subsection{Segmentation-based Methods}
The functional networks estimated from ICA are represented by continuous numbers
and have to be normalized to z score and thresholded to give a binary map. The
thresholding add ambiguity to the consistency of the results. An alternative
class of methods explore the functional patterns by defining it as a image
segmentation problem. It can be also viewed as a data clustering
problem. However, since the data points are indeed voxels in the fMRI images,
the spatial context information is also useful for the clustering. Therefore, we
name this class of methods as image segmentation, to indicate the possible usage
of spatial information. Once the fMRI images are segmented into various disjoint
set of regions, the voxels in the same regions have higher correlation, and
hence believed to be functionally connected. Compared to ICA, the segmentation
problem typically has a binary map for each functional network, i.e. clusters,
although some soft segmentation methods exist. The methods used for segmentation
include hierarchical clustering~\cite{salvador2005neurophysiological,
  cohen2008defining, cordes2002hierarchical, bellec2010multi}, partitioning
clustering~\cite{bellec2010multi} and spectral clustering
methods~\cite{van2008normalized, craddock2012whole}. The early works of fMRI
image segmentation~\cite{cordes2002hierarchical} are limited to a few slices due
to the computation cost. Even within a few slices, the segmentation method is
still able to identify the major functional components, and they shows that the
results are robust to the confounds due to the subject motion and physiological
noise. One interesting property of the hierarchical clustering technique is the
potential of detecting the hierarchy of the brain's functional
organization. Since the brain's functional patterns are widely believed to be
also hierarchical~\cite{yeo2011organization}, a computational method will be
very useful if it can naturally identify the sub-clusters within certain
cluster. Notice that the hierarchical clustering method is different from the
\emph{hierarchical MRF} method in the following chapter. The former builds a
hierarchy on the clusters, while our method builds the hierarchy on the group and
subjects' functional network maps.

Among the segmentation methods, Mezer et. al~\cite{mezer2009cluster} uses the
windowed Fourier transform and the spectrum below 0.2 Hz on the frequency
domain, as well as the BOLD time series in the original image domain as features
for the K-Means clustering. To test if the clusters estimated by K-Means is
significantly different, they use a repeated measure ANOVA test between each
pair of clusters. The experiments in Mezer's work found strong links between the
functional patterns and the tissue architecture, suggesting the possibility that
the rs-fMRI signal may includes the contributions from physiological and
artifact noise factors that can not be easily separated. In Figure
\ref{fig:coherence}, we did a simple experiments for using spectral coherence as
the similarity measures and use spectral methods for segmentation. From the
figure, we can identify the visual area (the green) and the functional regions
at temporal lobes (blue). Since we define each voxel as a node on the graph, the
similarity matrix's computation takes long time. The example here uses only 10 z
slices for illustration.

% Difficulties of defining the nodes of the graph. Choosing ROI is hard (ref:
% Jonathan D. Power for choosing nodes, functional parcellation 200 (cadmeron?). 
The number of clusters in the segmentation problem is a difficult problem of
model selection. Most of the methods use 7 clusters since it has a good match
with the existing cognitive network
configuration~\cite{yeo2011organization}. Other choice are possible if the goal
is to identify the functional patterns at a finer scale. Another situation of
choosing large number of clusters lies in the goal of finer parcellation in the
local scale. In a local parcellation, only the locally coherent functional
regions are grouped into same cluster. The remote functional regions may not be
grouped into same cluster even they belong to the same functional
network~\cite{mezer2009cluster}. This is similar to the super-pixel approach
widely used in the computer vision community~\cite{levinshtein2009turbopixels,
  achanta2012slic}, where people group similar pixels in to small regions as a
preprocessing step. The grouping procedure is conservative such that only the
spatially neighboring pixels are grouped. The super-pixels are used for the
higher level image understanding problem in order to save computation time. One
example of such functional network parcellation is
Thiron~\cite{thirion2006dealing}, where the primary goal is to find spatially
coherent clusters that are connected. Therefore, the spatially remote regions
cannot be classified into same cluster. The advantage of such parcellation is
the small regions modeled as groups of voxels better represent true regions of
activity in task-based fMRI data, and is less sensitive to the mis-registration
across subjects. It also reduce the multiple comparison problem that is typically
found in the statistical parametric mapping method. Thiron et. al. uses a
spectral clustering approach that use multidimensional scaling (MDS)
representation of the dataset, and the C-Means method for clustering. The method
is able to estimate a spatial coherent group clustering from the subject
parcellations. Another example of finer parcellation is Craddock
et. al~\cite{craddock2012whole}. The goal of this work is to evaluate the
suitability of a few parcellation scheme on a group of subjects rs-fMRI data. The
authors use normalized cut method~\cite{shi2000normalized} to segment the brain
into large number of spatial and functional homogeneous regions. A graph is
defined by only adding edges between spatial neighbors, with the weights on
edges defined by the linear correlation between BOLD signals. That means the
functionally homogeneous voxels may be in different clusters if they are not
spatially adjacent. Since the number of clusters in their experiments is
relative large (50 - 400), the estimated parcellation map will not be easily
interpreted as functional networks, but will be used for further analysis. For
group parcellation, Craddock et. al. use a second level group clustering similar
to the work of Van den Heuvel~\cite{van2008normalized}. The estimated adjacency
matrix estimated from subject parcellation were averaged across subjects, and
the average matrix was used for a second level normalized cut algorithm.

The segmentation of functional network is not necessarily limited on rs-fMRI
data. It can also be used for the task-based fMRI. The work of Michel
et. al~\cite{michel2012supervised} is one example in this range. Michel uses a
generalized hierarchical clustering based on Ward algorithm to build a tree of
hierarchical clusters. The leaves of the tree is individual voxels, and the root
includes all voxels. The author computed the optimal pruning of the tree by fit
the average signals of the leaves at each pruning depth to a general linear
model. the clusters of optimal trees are able to predict the behavior
variables. Varoquaux from the same research group use the method's of Michel
et. al.~\cite{michel2012supervised} for solving a active region detection
problem of task-based fMRI data~\cite{varoquaux2012small}. While the goal of
Michel et. al. is to identify the functional network patterns using the
supervised clustering method with clinical variables, the goal of
Varoquaux~\cite{varoquaux2012small} is to detection of active regions when the
observation is small and number of predictors are large. By grouping spatially
adjacent voxels with similar BOLD signals into cluster and use the cluster as
the independent variables, the author solve the problem of large number of
predictors, and can identify voxels more than the number of observations.

    followed by a K-Means clustering. We choose 12 clusters and 10 slices on z
    direction to save computation time. }
  \label{fig:coherence}
\end{figure}

Some of methods we proposed in Chapter \ref{chap:method2} and \ref{chap:method3}
belong to the class of segmentation. However, we defined the additional
structures based on the spatial context information, and the inter-subject
coherence assumption, so the model is more complex than the above works,
therefore need more advanced statistical inference methods.

\subsection{Methods Based on Graph Theory}
Functional networks can also be represented by graph~\cite{bullmore2009complex,
  achard2006resilient, sporns2004organization}. The developments of our
understanding of the complex systems, and the increasing availability of large
datasets of systems has led to a insight that these complex systems share
similar behavior that can be represented by the same
parameters\cite{bullmore2009complex}. To build an abstract graph from the fMRI
data, one typically choose some ROIs as the node of the graph, and estimate the
existence or lack of edges between the nodes. The signal on each node is
computed by averaging the BOLD signals of all the voxels within certain radius
of the ROI, usually a few millimeters (see figure ~\ref{fig:brain_graph} for an
illustration). The edge is estimated by computing the linear correlation or the
frequency coherence between two ROIs. Once the functional network is represented
by a graph, a rich class of methods in graph theory can be used to explore the
global property of the graph. For example, the high degree of a node indicates
its role as a hub in the network, and the distribution of the degrees are used
to explore the vulnerability of the graph when some \emph{hubs} are removed from
the network. Various measures of the network topology are estimated from the
graph to explore the similarity and difference between brain's functional
network and other complex network such as social network and wireless
network. The graph property can also be used to explore how the functional
system is configured to allow maximum flow of information with the minimal
wiring. For example, the \emph{small-worldness} attribute is shared by many
real-world networks including brain's functional network, and it is hypothesized
that the small-worldness is chosen by evolution for high efficiency of
information transfer between nodes at low connection
cost~\cite{achard2006resilient, bullmore2009complex, bullmore2012economy}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/c2/brain_graph}
  \caption{Using graph to represent functional networks. A series ROI are chosen
    based on what question to ask, the signal at each ROI is computed by
    averaging the BOLD signal signals of all voxels within the sphere. The edge
    of the graph is estimated using the similarity of the signal between the
    ROIs. }
  \label{fig:brain_graph}
\end{figure}

The network estimation results heavily depend on how we define the nodes of the
graph. Nodes should be defined as a brain regions with homogeneous functional
and anatomical patterns. The comparison of functional and structural networks is
meaningful only when they share the same definition of graph
nodes~\cite{rubinov2010complex}. Due the limits on the available methods and
computation resources of estimating networks with continuous edge weights,
typically one constructs a binary network by thresholding the similarity
matrix. How to choose the optimal thresholding parameter is an open
questions. More importantly, there is no principal method for combing the
networks from a group of subjects.

\subsection{Group Analysis}
%% [Group of subjects. Variation and shared information. resting-state intrinsic
%% cognition. 1000 connectomes. ]

The analysis fMRI data is challenging, due to the scanner noise, physiological
noise such as blood vessel and heart beat, subject's head motion. Sometimes
subjects have random thoughts even instructed not thinking anything specifically
during the data acquisition. The functional connectivity and network estimation
is still not accurate and consistent even various preprocessing techniques are
used. On the other hand, because rs-fMRI experiments have much lower requirement
to the patient subjects or control subjects compared to a paradigm design
experiments, it is possible to collect the rs-fMRI data from a big group of
subjects. the functional networks detected by either model-based methods such as
seed-based correlation, or data-driven methods such as ICA, are highly
reproducible across participants and scans. The more accurate and consistent
functional networks can be estimated by using the statistical power of the group
analysis. With the initiative of 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, large
cohort of data are available for researchers to explore the relationship of
functional networks to the subjects age, gender etc.

% seed-based methods extend to grp analysis.
Compared with single-subject analysis, the methods for multiple-subject
functional network analysis are not yet established. The seed-based methods
typically compute the correlation or regression coefficients between regions
independently for each subject. The correlations or regression coefficients are
treated as a statistics of each subjects, and go into a second level
analysis. The second level can be either fixed-effect analysis, or a
random-effect analysis with a standard hypothesis testing. The population-based
z-score maps have to be corrected for multiple comparisons~\cite{fox2005human}.

% group ICA
Group ICA is used as an extension of single-subject ICA in order to seek a set
of independent components shared across multiple
subjects~\cite{calhoun2001spatial}. In a typical group ICA study, all subjects
are registered to a common atlas and assumed to share a common spatial component
map but have distinct time courses. The BOLD signals from all subjects are
concatenated temporally, followed by a single subject ICA. The subject component
maps are then obtained by a back-reconstruction procedure. 

Alternatively, single-subject ICA is applied on each subject first, and a group
summary is estimated from the estimates of subject functional patterns. Some
methods that we have introduced as segmentation-based
approach~\cite{bellec2010multi,craddock2012whole} are in this range. If the ICA
is used for estimating the spatial patterns at subject level, it is not
straightforward to conglomerate the spatial maps of multiple subjects and derive
a optimal set of group maps. This is because the component maps of subjects are
not perfectly in align with each other, and it is difficult to find the
correspondence between subject A's component $i$ and subject B's component
$j$. To solve this problem, Esposito et. al.~\cite{esposito2005independent}
proposed a \emph{self organizing} method for the group map estimation. A series
of spatial component maps are estimated by regular ICA method for each subjects,
and these maps are all put in a single pool, and the similarity between each
pair of component map in this pool is defined and computed. Then, the author did
a clustering on the pool of component maps. The cluster center of the maps is
believed to be the group component map. Neither of the above approaches
iteratively refine group (or subject) maps once the subjects (or group) maps are
estimated.

Varoquaux et. al.~\cite{varoquaux2010group} gives a extension of ICA for group
analysis. The author defines a generative model, in which the subjects component
maps are assumed to be generated from a group component map. In particular, the
subject map is a weighted group map with additive noise term, and the observed
BOLD signal of each subject is a linear combination of subject's components with
additive noise. The estimation takes two steps. At subject level, each subject's
data is decomposed by principal component analysis and obtain a estimate of the
subject component map. At group level, the author use canonical correlation
analysis (CCA) to find a common subspace among the estimated subject component
maps. Such an approach is in the class of \emph{bottom-up} methods that we
introduced in Figure \ref{fig:bidirections}, since the group component map
estimate is not used to iteratively refine the subject estimation. Besides,
there seems a discrepancy between the group map definition and estimation. That
is, the author did not give any justification that CCA gives an optimal estimate
of the generate model defined on group level.

Another interesting work of Varoquaux et. al~\cite{varoquaux2011multi} uses
dictionary learning for the group analysis. Dictionary learning is in the class
of linear signal decomposition, with ICA as a special case. In this work, the
author again defined a generative model, where the observed subject data matrix
is the product of the loading matrix (i.e. the weighting coefficients) and a
signal matrix (also called the code in the dictionary). The loading matrix is
the subject specific spatial map, and is generated from a population spatial map
with an additive noise term. The objective function can be written as a
non-hierarchical form, and is the function of the subject component map and
group component map. The optimization is done by an coordinate descent
approach. Overall, the model is similar to what we will propose in Chapter
\ref{chap:method3} in that a hierarchical map is defined and estimated. In
addition, it is different from previous work~\cite{varoquaux2010group} as the
group and subject maps are estimated iteratively in the coordinate descent
framework. So, Varoquaux's this method is indeed a counterpart of our
hierarchical Markov random field model, but in the linear signal decomposition
fields.

% assumption of the group study. challenges of group study.
Despite the promising future of using large population for studying the
functional network and its relationship to underlining structural patten, the
group study also poses new challenges when putting all datasets together. The
folding patterns of the cortical surface, and the structure and size of brain
regions are all different across individual subjects. Because of such structural
variation, the inter-subject registration is often not accurate enough to map
same anatomical structures to same coordinates in standard space. This may be
due to the imperfect co-registration algorithm itself, and also due to the
difference of individual subjects cortical structures. Even the anatomical
structures are aligned among multiple subjects, the functional patterns of each
subject are not exactly same. Although numerous studies have shown the
relationship of the functional connectivity is related to the structural
connectivity~\cite{honey2009predicting,hermundstad2013structural,
  honey2007network}, it is less well know how and to what extent this
relationship is reflected by the variation of functional connectivity.

\subsection{MRF and Spatial Constraints}

%% in this group.
Because of the univariate characteristic of the statistic parametric mapping
(SPM)~\cite{friston2007statistical} method, the spatial context information is
not taken into account in the model. That is, if one arbitrarily permute the
voxels location in the brain, the resulted activation map in a task-based
experiment does not change, i.e. the original activated voxels are still
activated. To take the spatial information into account, one typically force the
spatial homogeneity by applying a Gaussian filter on the spatial domain as a
preprocessing step. The filter increase the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio but
inevitably has a blurring effect that sometimes result in the loss of finer
structures of the functional patterns. 

Markov random field (MRF) as a principal method of modeling spatial context
prior has been brought into image processing fields by
Geman~\cite{geman1984stochastic}. The first application of MRF to fMRI analysis
is by Descombes et. al.~\cite{descombes_spatio-temporal_1998}. Although this is
an early work of MRF's application, we give some details of their work because
of its novelty. In their work, the author proposed to use MRF for two
purposes. First, they used a spatio-temporal MRF to restore the noisy BOLD
signal instead of a general temporal filter and spatial Gaussian filter. Second,
the restored BOLD signal is compared with the stimulus haemodynamic response
function for detecting the activation map, which is modeled by a spatial
MRF. For the first goal of BOLD signal restoration, the authors defined a graph,
whose nodes or voxels have 12 neighbors --- 8 as the spatial neighbors, and 4 as
temporal neighbors. A hidden continuous variable is defined at each node of each
time point to represent the true BOLD signal's intensity. To preserve the
discontinuity, another line process MRF is defined on the dual lattice to model
the existence or lack of edge between spatial neighbors. The statistical
inference of this spatio-temporal MRF is solved by simulated annealing (SA). For
activity detection, a second MRF was defined on the activation variables, and
the MRF only included spatial neighbors. Although the work was applied on the
fMRI data in paradigm design, the concept of spatial regularization and Bayesian
method is also applicable to the rs-fMRI data.

Another early work of Hartvig et. al.~\cite{hartvig2000spatial} aims at the
using the spatial context information for activation detection of task-based
fMRI experiments. The author's inductive bias is the activation region should
not be too big or to small. According to this assumption, they define a hidden
activation variable taking value in $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ to represent negative-active,
no-activation, and activation state. And the estimated activation coefficients
from the standard SPM are assume to be Gaussian given the hidden variable is
no-activation, and Gamma distribution given the hidden variable is
activated. The prior distribution of a small set of neighboring voxels' hidden
variables are defined to reflect the inductive bias, and the goal is to estimate
the posterior of the hidden activation variable given the observed activation
coefficients from SPM. Hartvig's model is not MRF strictly speaking, though the
model represent author's assumption of the spatial context.

A recent work of application of MRF to task-based fMRI data is by Ou
et. al.~\cite{ou2010combining}. In their work, the authors define a MRF on the
activation variables, and the MRF prior favors spatially coherent activated
regions. The conditional probability of the observed data is defined by a
general linear model (GLM) with the hidden activation variables as
parameters. One important characteristics of Ou's work is the parameter
estimation, including both the GLM's parameter and the MRF's parameter. The
author defined the MRF prior such that the the samples draw from the prior agree
with the spatial properties of the true activation map in fMRI
experiments. Therefore they used the frequency counts to set the pairwise
potentials with an additional parameter to control the overall \emph{sharpness}
of the joint component of the prior. This method is similar to the work of
Boykov et. al.~\cite{boykov2001interactive} and Rother
et. al.~\cite{rother2004grabcut}, where a parameter is estimate from the data by
counting over the whole image. The additional parameter is also estimated from
the data in simulated experiments. It is noted Ou's method is for single
subject.

Penny et. al~\cite{penny2005bayesian} define a MRF on the regression
coefficients of the general linear model on a task-based experiment. Because the
regression coefficients are continuous, the author model the prior distribution
by the multivariate Gaussian distribution, with precision matrix represented by
a Laplacian operator. This Laplacian operator penalizes differences between
neighboring voxel's coefficients. In the generative model, the sample of this
prior distribution can be generated by first draw independent samples from
Gaussian, and then applying the Laplacian operator mapping.

Overall, the methods of functional network estimations has been from the basic
seed-based approach, to more advanced multivariate, full brain analysis, and
from single subject analysis, to a pooled summary of multiple subject analysis,
to the more complex joint analysis of both population and individuals. In the
following chapters, I will introduce our contribution to the methods by
combining MRF and hierarchical model. It should be noted that the more complex
method will achieve better results only when the model fits the data well, and
th statistical inference will successfully the optimum or reasonably approximate
the optimum solution.
