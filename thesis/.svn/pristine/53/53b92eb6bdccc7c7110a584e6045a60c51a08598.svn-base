-- add clinical motivation in chap 1.
-- check the weiliu/research to see if I can add anything. 
-- lesion segmentation as a preprocessing step of fMRI analysis.
-- talk about the similarity criteria. ICC rand index etc.
-- Discuss why it is not feasible to define a group distribution on top of subject distribution and still have MRF on the group.  Dirichlet distribution. 

-- in 6dmrf model, the there are 2 modes in the mixture, which is similar to the mixture model used for task based data. 

-- add Woolrich "mixture models with adaptive spatial regularization...." to the related work chapter, MRF section. 

-- if you have time, add the Wood's vMF simulation method into the method2 as a appendix.
