\chapter{General Discussion}
\label{chap:alldiscussion}
In this chapter we will give a summary of the dissertation work, with some
discussions on the models we have used. We will also discuss the possible
extension of our models in the future, and other general promising approaches
of rs-fMRI study.

\section{Summary of Dissertation  work}
The analysis of functional networks using rs-fMRI is a difficult problem, due to
various sources of noise, the artifact introduced by the preprocessing, and the
variations between the subjects in the same group. In this dissertation we proposed a
hypothesis that a hierarchical MRF model is able to describe the within-subject
spatial coherence and the between-subject similarity, with higher estimation
accuracy on simulated data and higher consistency on real data. The three
applications of our models proved our hypothesis. More specifically:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We proposed a high-dimensional MRF model to depict our prior information
    on the pairwise connectivity variables of a single subject rs-fMRI
    dataset. The MRF enforced similar values of the adjacent variables, where
    the adjacency is defined by the MRF structure. We are able to identify finer
    functional patterns without resorting to spatial smoothing.

  \item We also presented a \emph{maximum a posteriori} framework for estimating
    multiple functional networks of a single subject, by using MRF in original
    image space, and a vMF distribution as likelihood function. Again, with the
    proposed method, we identified functional networks that are spatially
    coherent, and more consistent across subjects compared to other standard
    methods.

  \item Last, we extended the MRF model to a hierarchical setting, where both
    the within-subject spatial coherence and between-subject similarity are
    modeled by a single graphical model. By sampling from the posterior
    distribution of the network variables, we are able to show that the network
    maps are more accurate for synthetic data, and more consistent for real data
    compared to the flat model of group analysis.
\end{itemize}

Here we give a brief comparison the three methods that we discussed in Chapters
\ref{chap:method1}, \ref{chap:method2} and \ref{chap:method3}. The pairwise
connectivity estimation method in Chapter \ref{chap:method1} is a lower level
information extraction compared to other methods. The algorithm aims to estimate
the functional connectivities between voxel pairs, without knowledge of the
functional system. Because the connectivity variables we are interested in only
have two states, connected or not connected, we deal with a unsupervised binary
classification problem. We define a model similar to the standard Gaussian
mixture (GMM) model, and estimate the posterior of the hidden variables. Our
model is different from the regular GMM in that we define a prior distribution
on the hidden variables, the connectivity. The prior distribution is indeed a
MRF, or equivalently, Gibbs distribution, defined on a high-dimensional graph to
represent our knowledge of the spatial soft constraints. The inference, as a
result of this additional prior model, is significantly more difficult than GMM,
since the inference of each pairwise connectivity cannot be factorized like
standard GMM due to the statistical dependency on other variables. We use
variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the
connectivity variables and solved the intractable optimization problem.

The second method we discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:method2} is in a higher
level than the pairwise connectivity estimation in Chapter
\ref{chap:method1}. The algorithm outputs a three-dimensional label map, and
the labeling represents the functional systems. Compared to Chapter
\ref{chap:method1}, here we are able to detect all functional systems without
defining a seed region, and show them in a single spatial map. The algorithm
is aware of the functional system, as each cluster represents one
system. Although the ability to identify multiple systems is a strength
compared to the previous pairwise connectivity estimation, it is hard to state
the multiple network detection method is superior to the pairwise connectivity
estimation method, as the two methods are at different levels. The lower-level
pairwise connectivity estimated can be used in other models as input. For
example, it can be used to define the ROIs for the graph-based analysis. Or,
the prior distribution of the connectivity variables can be modified to
include an additional parameter for multisubject analysis. The current prior
distribution of the connectivity variables are defined by a MRF including only
smoothing constraints. In the case of multiple subjects, we can assume the
same pairwise connectivity variable for all subjects are random variables from
a population distribution. By redefining the six-dimensional graph and
including other subjects, and a group layer, we have a hierarchical model for
the pairwise connectivity variables, much like what we have done in the HMRF
model in Chapter \ref{chap:method3}.

% add the general discussion for the last paper. 
Both the algorithms in Chapters \ref{chap:method1} and \ref{chap:method2} deal
with single subject. By contrast, the hierarchical MRF model in Chapter
\ref{chap:method3} explores the functional patterns from the rs-fMRI of a group
of subjects. It turns out if we integrate our knowledge of the within-subject
smoothness and the between-subject similarity into the graph structure, we can
convert the group inference problem into a standard inference of the posterior
distribution. So we defined an abstract layer of the graph including all the gray
matter voxels in the subject volumes, and a \emph{virtual} volume of the
group. Below this layer is the image voxels of the subjects and groups
volume. Above the layer, we have a standard graph and we are able to apply
a standard optimization algorithm on it. The single-subject MCEM method we
proposed in Chapter \ref{chap:method2} is a special case of our extended HMRF
model. We have shown that the extended model is able to enforce the
similarity of the functional patterns across subjects, as well as estimating a
group map. Because a single subject can borrow statistical power from other
subjects via the group level, we can estimate a reasonable map even from  noisy
single-subject data.

A classical occurrence of hierarchical models is the inclusion of the
random-effects in the linear model~\cite{robert2007bayesian}. For a simple
example, suppose we randomly choose $M$ schools from all the schools in the
country, and randomly choose $N$ students from each school and record their
scores on an exam. We use $y_{ij}$ to denote the score of the student $n$ from
school $m$. The score can be modeled by a linear model with random-effects
$y_{nm} = \beta + \theta_m + w_{nm}$, where $\beta$ is the average score of the
population, $\theta_m$ is the school-specific random effect that represents the
difference between the population's average score $\beta$ and school $m$'s
score, and $w_{nm}$ is the individual student's deviation from the school's
average score. Both $\theta_m$ and $w_{nm}$ are random variables since the
schools and the students are randomly chosen. The above linear model can be
decomposed into a hierarchical model as
\begin{align*}
  y_{nm} &= u_m + w_{nm}\\
  u_m &= \beta + \theta_m.
\end{align*}
Here $u_m$ is the average score for the school $m$, and is further decomposed
into the fixed effects $\beta$ and random effects $\theta_m$. In our multilevel
model for the rs-fMRI group analysis, the BOLD time series correspond to the
student score $y$, the subject network label maps correspond to the average
score $u$ of the school, and the group label map corresponds to the population's
average score $\beta$. vMF distribution denotes the random effects of the BOLD
signals, hence is similar to the $w$ in the above example. Because the
parameters (called hidden variables in our model) are discrete values, there is
no direct counterpart of $\theta$ in our model, but the MRF and its equivalent
Gibbs distribution represent the random properties of the group and subject
label maps.

There are reasons of this decomposition and the formulation by Bayesian
rules~\cite{robert2007bayesian}. First, the two levels of models represent the
prior knowledge of the metapopulation. The hierarchical models naturally
appeared in the metaanalysis. In the case of fMRI study, the results of the
analysis on other subjects can be used as a prior of current subjects. Second,
the hierarchical model can separate the priors into two components. One
component corresponds to the soft constraints applied on the subject level
parameters (subject network label map), and the other component represents the
uncertainty of such constraints, i.e., the distribution of the group label map,
as well as the unknown weight parameters between the subject and the group. Also,
the decomposition can often simplify the posterior inference of the hidden
variable, at least on the concept level.



\section{HMM versus CRF}
The MRF, as a extension of the one-dimensional hidden Markov model (HMM), is a
model that does not depend on the observed data. The conditional random field
(CRF), on the contrary, has a regularization energy function that depends on
the data. One of the reasons that the prior energy should be dependent on the
data is that the smoothness assumption is often violated at the
discontinuities, i.e., the edges in the image, be it natural scene images or
fMRI images. When the BOLD signal at certain voxel is significantly different
from one of its spatial neighbor's, we have reason not want to borrow
information from this neighbor. Intuitively this makes sense, although in such
a definition, the separation of the prior $P(X)$ and the conditional
probability $P(Y|X)$ would not be possible, since $P(X)$ also involves the
data $Y$. The CRF is called adaptive smoothing in some
literature~\cite{LiBook}.

Historically, the existence or lack of links between spatially adjacent nodes on
a regular lattice is modeled by a line process by
Geman~\cite{geman1984stochastic}. The inference is iterated between estimating
the MRF with image pixels at nodes, and estimating line process. At last, when
both the MRF and the line process converge, we just discard the line process
estimation but keep the estimation of the nodes in MRF. The estimated nodes will
be from the marginal distribution according to the original MRF.  However, even
the links are modeled as a line process, the hidden variable $X$ is still in a
distribution that does not include $Y$. So fundamentally such model is the same with
regular MRF, rather than a CRF. It is the optimization methods that differ.

CRF is a reasonable model in some situations, when the disparity of the
neighboring voxels represents the discontinuity of the images. In some cases, if
a voxel is very noisy, such that its signal looks significantly different than
its neighbors, while in fact the difference is due to  large noise, the CRF
may assume the discontinuity at this edge, and does not define, or defines a weak
interaction. Therefore, the noisy voxel may not be correctly classified. In such
situations, the data $Y$ is essentially used twice, once in the prior distribution
$P(X)$, and the other in the likelihood function $P(Y)$. Because we increase the
weight of the data term, the CRF will fail to estimate the correct hidden
variables when the data are noisy. In practice, in a multimodality image
segmentation problem, we used CRF and found some noisy voxels were not labeled
correctly because the CRF removed the edge between the noisy voxels and their
neighbors due to the large intensity difference. One possible solution of this
incorrect edge determination is to use a larger neighborhood when computing the
discontinuity, thus decreasing the influence of the single noisy
pixel~\cite{tanaka2008locally}.

In our model, we choose to use HMM instead of CRF with the belief that a simple
Bayesian model will conceptually fit our problem and have good generalization
power. It is worth applying the CRF model to our hierarchical MRF
framework. Because of its Bayesian concept, HMM is easier to understand than the
CRF. However, in some situations if the CRF outperforms HMM and Bayesian-based models,
it will be an open question  if we are willing to give up a little
performance in order to obtain a simple model that we can understand.

\section{Convergence rate of MCMC}
One of the main disadvantages of the MCMC algorithm, or the general Monte Carlo
sampling algorithm, is the slow convergence and long computation time. Although,
the computation time is not a critical issue in the fMRI study, this is an
interesting and actively evolving topic that is worth  discussion. With the
high-level data parallel frameworks such as MapReduce, the processing of
large-scale data is greatly simplified. These data processing frameworks do
not support the core data mining and machine learning algorithms. Many datasets
have variables that are interdependent with each other, and a graphical model is
a good abstract representation for these multivariate data. The statistical
inference often involves computing the posterior probability of the variables
given the observation. When the prior distribution and likelihood function
cannot be defined as a conjugate distribution, one alternative method will be
sampling from the posterior and use Monte Carlo averaging for the inference. In
this parallel framework, it is natural to run the sampling on the parallel
machine for faster convergence. The state-of-the-art method implemented in the
\textsf{GraphLab}, the parallel graph abstract
library~\cite{low2012distributed}, uses the graph coloring technique to divide
the nodes in the original graph into $K$ subsets. Within the subsets, the nodes
have the same color, and are updated in parallel. Between different colors of
subsets, the nodes are updated in sequential. Such strategy is exactly the same with
our implementation in Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, where we also divide the
nodes into four subsets to avoid the checkerboard local minium.

Without multiple-core machines, a common method of accelerating the mixing of
the Gibbs sampler is to update the variables in a batch mode, i.e., in a
block. The Swendsen-Wang algorithm~\cite{wang1987nonuniversal} and its
extension~\cite{barbu2005generalizing} are in this category. The key to the
block update is to find those variables that are strongly coupled with each
other and can be updated together. A recent development along this line is by
Hamze and Freitas~\cite{hamze2004fields}. In their work, the authors divide the
nodes into two subsets such that each subset of nodes is a tree. A tree, as a
special case of general graph, does not have a loop of edges, and it is therefore
significantly easier to compute the posterior distribution. By using the
Rao-Blackwell transformation, they give an algorithm that combines analytical
and sampling steps. Given a sample of one tree, the algorithm uses belief
propagation~\cite{yedidia2003understanding} to compute the exact distribution of
the other tree conditioned on the sample. This block update scheme is proved
to have better convergence property than stand Gibbs sampling. The algorithm of
Gonzalez et al.~\cite{gonzalez2011parallel} also uses a similar concept.

\section{Future works}
Graphical model and its undirected variants of MRF are powerful tools for
modeling multivariate random variables and their uncertainty. Here we give
possible extensions of our computational models to dynamical settings, to
specific mental health disorders and to the integrated spatiotemporal models. 

\subsection{Dynamics of the functional network}
In conventional brain connectivity analysis one assumes that the
connections between regions are static and do not change with time. The
functional connectivity may not be in a stationary state. Not like structural
connectivity measured by DTI, the functional connections depend on the the
cognitive activity of the human brain, and may change over time. For example,
the most active regions during resting-state seem to be the regions that shows
the greatest deactivation during external cognitive challenges. Besides,
functional links can persist even without direct anatomical connection.

Zalesky et al.~\cite{zalesky2011relationship} tested the variation of the fMRI
time series by splitting the time series into two parts, and used paired T test to
test any difference between the two halves with respect to the various statistical
measures, including variance, maximum and minimum amplitude. They did not
identify a significant difference. This suggests that there is no long-term
variation on the time series, but this is not sufficient to suggest that the
functional network is static.

One interpretation of the intrinsic activity, especially the dynamics of the
patterns is an inner state of exploration where the brain generates predictions
about the best possible network patterns that would be optimal for an impending
future external event~\cite{deco2010emerging}. If that is the case, it will be
beneficial to study the dynamics of the functional network for better
understanding how the brain predicts  external events and prepares for
them. There have been works that model the complex network's dynamics with time
delay, mostly notably the models proposed by Honey et
al.~\cite{honey2007network}, Deco et al.~\cite{deco2009key}, Ferguson et
al.~\cite{ferguson2012dynamical} and Ghosh et al.~\cite{ghosh2008noise}.  In
Honey et al.~\cite{honey2007network}, the structure connectivity matrix is first
computed, and neural dynamical potential signal is simulated. The neural
potential has a high sampling rate. The functional connectivity is computed from
this simulated time course signal at different temporal scale. BOLD signal is
also simulated from the neural potential signal by the \emph{balloon}
model. The simulated BOLD signal has coarser spatial resolution compared the
neural potential signal, i.e., BOLD is simulated per region. The authors
concluded that functional connectivity estimated from  whole neural potential
signals are more consistent with structural network, while the network estimated
from a segment of neural signals have more transient network patterns. In
Ghosh et al.~\cite{ghosh2008noise}, the low level neural signal is also simulated
similar to Honey et al.~\cite{honey2007network}, and BOLD signal is computed from these
simulated signals. The difference from the work of Honey et al. is that the authors added time
delay between the regions, and the delay is proportional to the distance between
the regions. For the study of fMRI, we do not have to assume a model for neural
potential signal and simulate it. An direct way is to define a dynamic model for
BOLD signal. To model the dynamics of the network, we can either explicitly
model the time delay due to the transmission of the neural signal in the fibers,
or we can choose not model this time delay. Honey et al.~\cite{honey2007network}
do not model the time delay, which is reasonable due to the low temporal
resolution of BOLD signal. The time delay, compared to the TR of BOLD signal,
can be ignored.

These models mainly explore the dynamic patterns of a single subject, with the
anatomical constraints applied on the possible functional structure. Although
the dynamics may differ across subjects, it would intriguing to study a group of
subjects' network dynamics and see if some patterns are shared among them. It
would be a reasonable assumption that the parameters of the dynamic model are
similar across subjects. For instance, if we assume a ROI swith between mental
states with certain probability, the probability as a parameter on the Markov
chain, might be shared across subjects with some variation. Along this line of
thought, we can even model the common parameters across subjects in a
hierarchical way.  To model the dynamics of the functional networks, some new
techniques about network dynamics~\cite{boccaletti2006complex,
  holme2012temporal, kolar2010estimating, arenas2008synchronization,
  mortveit2008introduction} are required besides our hierarchical model.

\subsection{Functional connectivity in clinical study} 
The intrinsic activity, as the baseline signal for task-based analysis not
only helps understanding subject's functional patterns for specific tasks, but
also in studying mental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
Alzheimer's~\cite{buckner2009cortical, huang2010learning, minshew2010nature,
  anderson2011functional, nielsen2013multisite}. For instance, in a review of
an ADHD study~\cite{castellanos2011large}, the author found the default model
network has less anticorrelation for ADHD patients. Since the strong
anticorrelation is believed to be related to  better behavioral
performance, such findings help the understanding and treatment of ADHD
patients.

One particular interesting application of functional connectivity is the
classification of ASDs and typical developing group.  The classification of
autism and control groups can be cast into a regression problem by defining the
pairwise functional connectivity as independent variables and the autism
diagnostic scores as the dependent variables. By this definition, we aim to use
rs-fMRI data to predict autism patients. The correct prediction of 
autism patients is not the only goal. By solving the linear regression problem,
it becomes possible to pinpoint one or more functional connectivity variables
that are strongly correlated to  autism clinical scores, and even the
anatomical regions that are involved in these important connectivity
variables. Because of connectivity variables are pairwise, the number of such
variables is large. For a set of ROIs defined by Power et al.~\cite{power2011functional}
with 264 nodes, the number of pairwise connectivity variables will be $264\times
263 / 2 = 34,716$. For the denser ROIs used By
Anderson et al.~\cite{anderson2011functional}, there are 7,266 seed regions, and the
number of pairwise connectivity variables will be $26,397,378$. On the contrary,
the number of observations (subjects) for such types of studies is much
smaller. Therefore, we face the typical \emph{curse of dimensionality}
problem. Rich literature in the machine learning community are available for
addressing such problems. An early and simple solution is feature selection,
i.e., selecting only a subset of the independent variables and discarding
others. The regression is performed between those chosen variables and the
dependent variables.

To select $k$ features with good predictability from $n$ features is an
intractable optimization problem due to the combinatorial number of
choices. One can use univariate methods with a hypothesis test to tell if a
feature can significantly separate apart the training sample set, or use more
advanced methods taking into account the interactions of the
features~\cite{guyon2003introduction,saeys2007review}. More modern methods
integrates feature and variable selection and classification in a single
framework, such as the $L1$ regularization methods, least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator (LASSO)~\cite{friedman2008sparse}.

With the autism brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE) repository open to the
public~\cite{di2013autism}, thousands of rs-fMRI datasets of both autism
patients and control groups from various sites are available for analysis. This
data sharing initiative is an opportunity to explore the relationship between
the functional connectivity and the ASDs in a large data cohort. However, due to
the different source of fMRI data, a simple pooling of all the subjects in a one
layer model may not work well, as has been shown by Nielsen et
al.~\cite{nielsen2013multisite}. The authors use 964 subjects from 16 separate
international sites and use the pairwise connectivity variables of all the
subjects to predict the autism variable, with the age variable taken into
account. Nielson et al. show the classification accuracy significantly outperformed
chance but is much lower than their previous results on single
site~\cite{anderson2011functional}. One possible reason is the heterogeneity of
the datasets due to the different sites, scanner parameters and
practitioners. We can extend our HMRF model to this problem by defining a
hierarchical regression and classification problem. By the hierarchy, we assume
the regression coefficients are also random variables, instead of fixed unknown
parameters. The coefficients are from a prior distribution with
hyper-parameters. With the hierarchical model, the regression is balanced
between the estimation purely from the data, and the estimation of other
sites. For example, if for one site, the training data has good quality and the
variance of the regression coefficients are small, the posterior distribution of
the coefficients of subjects in this particular site will be closer to the value
that fits the data, i.e., a estimate from standard regression. If the data of
one site is highly overlapped and nonseparable, the variance of the regression
coefficients will be larger, so the posterior mean of the coefficients will be
closer to the population's coefficients, which is estimated from other sites. In
this way, each site has its own parameter to model the data quality, and we may
achieve an overall higher rate of classification, and find more reliable
correspondence between the function regions and Autism disorder.

% spatio-temporal model from spatial statistics.
\subsection{Spatiotemporal Modeling} 
One interesting model that can be used for this spatio-temporal analysis is
the Gaussian process (GP). GP originates from linear regression problem $\vec
y = \vec w^{\top} \vec \phi(\vec x)$ with arbitrary basis function
$\phi(x)$. When the weight parameters $\vec w$ are unknown fixed constants,
the estimation of $\vec w$ can be solved be least square estimation, or
equivalently, maximum likelihood estimation when the data are Gaussian
distributed. We can define the $\vec w$ also as random variables, and
accordingly the response variable $\vec y $ will also be random. When $\vec w$
is of Gaussian distribution, the joint probability $P(\vec y, \vec w)$, the
conditional probability $P(\vec w | \vec y)$, and the predictive distribution
of $y'$ for a new data point $\vec x'$ are also Gaussian, and therefore the
statistical inference of $\vec y$ and $y'$ can be done in a closed form. The
standard linear regression with prior distribution defined on $\vec w$ is
solved in parameter space, i.e., by searching the optimal parameter $\vec w $
in a space that can maximize the posterior distribution of $\vec w$. GP adopts
a function view in that we define a distribution on the function $y(\vec
x)$. The variance of the functional value $y(x_n)$ and $y(x_m)$ can be
represented by the inner product of the basis function $\phi(x_n)$ and
$\phi(x_m)$, which can be defined directly by a kernel function of $x_n$ and
$x_m$. Most of the kernel function is defined such as the predicted value $y'$
depends more on data points $x$ that are closer to $x'$, although the
estimation of $y'$ uses the $y$ value of all the $x$ in the training
dataset. We can, however, make use of the Markov property and assume that $y'$
only depends on the nearby $y$. In one-dimensional case, the auto-regressive (AR) model is
a special case where the variable $y$ only depends on the limited number of
values of $y$ in the past. In such a model, the covariance matrix of the
function value $y$ is dense, but the inverse covariance matrix, i.e., the
precision matrix, is sparse, since it represents the conditional independence.

The extension to the spatiotemporal model has two possible options. We can
either start from a time series model for each spatial data point, such as
auto-regressive (AR), moving average (MA), or ARMA models, and assume the
model parameters depend on their spatial neighbors. Or, we can assume a
spatial model such as MRF, or Gaussian random field, and allow the parameters
to change over time instead of being fixed. Such a model would be helpful for the
analysis of fMRI data. For now, the spatial and temporal properties of BOLD
signal of fMRI data are typically addressed separately. The temporal model is
either represented by a frequency filter with the assumption of the interested
frequency band, or by using a explicit model such as AR process. The spatial
dependency is either enforced by a spatial Gaussian filter as a preprocessing
step, or modeled by MRF such as the HMRF in our work. A unified
spatiotemporal model will help the denoising, estimation, interpolation and
prediction of the fMRI data.
