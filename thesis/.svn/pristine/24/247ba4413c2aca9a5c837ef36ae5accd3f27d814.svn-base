Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the change of oxygen
consumption level in the blood vessel of the human brain, hence indirectly
detects the neuro activity. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is used to identify the
intrinsic functional patterns of the brain when there is no external
stimulus. Accurate estimation of intrinsic activity is important for
understanding the functional organization and dynamics of the brain, and
comparing the functional networks between normal people and patients with mental
disorder.

This thesis aims to robustly estimate the functional connectivities and networks
of the human brain using rs-fMRI data of multiple subjects. Through the thesis,
we extensively use Markov random field (MRF), an undirected graphical model to
represent our knowledge of the statistical dependency among the functional
network variables. Graphical model describes multivariate probability
distributions that can be factorized and represented by a graph. By defining the
nodes and the edges along with their weights according to our assumptions, we
build the soft-constraints into the graph structure as a prior information. The
goal then becomes the statistical inference of the posterior distribution of the
network variables given the data and the prior defined by the graph. For
discrete variables, the optimization is a combinatorial problem.  When the graph
is a chain or a tree, exact algorithms are available, but for general MRF the
posterior maximum can not be solved in polynomial time. We explore various
approximated optimization methods such as variational Bayesian, graph cuts, and
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC).

We apply the random field model to three related problems. In the first problem,
the goal is to detect the pairwise connectivity between gray matter voxels in a
rs-fMRI dataset of the single subject. We define a six dimensional graph to
represent our prior that two voxels are more likely to be connected if their
spatial neighbors are connected. The posterior mean of the connectivity
variables are estimated by the variational inference, also known as mean field
theory in statistical physics. The method proves to outperform the standard
spatial smoothing and is able to detect finer patterns of brain activity. Our
second work aims to identify multiple functional systems. We define a Potts
model, a special case of MRF on the network label variables, and define von
Mises-Fisher distribution on the normalized fMRI signal. The inference is
significant more difficult than the binary classification in previous
problem. We use MCMC to draw samples from the posterior distribution of network
labels. In the third application, we extend the graph to multiple subject
scenario. By building a graph including the network labels of both a group map
and the subject label maps, we define a hierarchical model that has richer
structure than the flat single-subject model, and captures the shared patterns
and also the variation among the subjects. All three applications use Bayesian
methods, and are data-driven by estimating parameters from the data. The
experiments shows that by the the regularization of MRF, the functional network
maps we estimated are more accurate, and more consistent across multiple
sessions.
