\section{Problem Statement}
Human brain is organized into distributed functional modules that work
independently for specific cognitive tasks, and also interact with each
other. It has been shown that the spontaneous fluctuation of the blood
oxygenation dependent (BOLD) signal, as measured by functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), is a valuable data source for delineating the
functional network organization. More recently, the spontaneous activity of
human brain gains more attention because of its potential of helping understand
the \emph{baseline} patterns of cognitive activity as well as the cause of some
cognitive diseases. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is accordingly widely used for
exploring such activities.

The analysis of rs-fMRI data is a challenging task, due to the scanner noise,
physiological noise, head motion, and subject's random thoughts during data
acquisition. 

Single
subject's data is often contaminated with noise of various sources, and its
results are typically unreliable and inconsistent for the statistical inference
of the whole population's intrinsic activity patterns.  On the other hand,
combining data from multiple subjects and jointly estimating the common
functional networks is more robust. In group analysis of rs-fMRI data, one
typically assumes that all subjects in the group share common functional
connectivity patterns, These group networks can be estimated more accurately
because the noise introduced in each subject is canceled by averaging. In
practice, it is a major challenge to summarize the consistent patterns across
subjects, as each subject's network patterns appear similar but have slight
variation due to the anatomical and functional difference across subjects.

Recent years has seen substantial interest in estimating functional networks of
individual subjects during group analysis. An accurate estimate of an
individual's network is an important step towards understanding of
brain-behavior relationships on a per-subject basis. The inter-subject variation
must be accounted for in order to obtain a good estimation of the networks of
individual subjects as well as the group.  Current
methods~\cite{yeo2011organization,damoiseaux2006consistent} either do not
estimate individual functional network maps, or not have an explicit statistical
model on the inter-subject variations~\cite{calhoun2001method,
  calhoun2001spatial}.  Among the methods that do estimate subject functional
networks, some have one or more of the drawbacks:

First, some methods map a common group functional network by concatenating the
BOLD signal from all subjects. By doing this, one implicitly assumes that the
voxels across subjects map to the same anatomical structure after
coregistration, and share the same functional connectivity patterns. These
assumptions are often violated due to the anatomical inhomogeneity between
subjects, and also due to the imperfect alignment of the existing coregistration
routine. In addition, the simple concatenation does not take into account the
possible different variance across subjects. In particular, some participants
may experience spontaneous, but active cognition during the scan even in the
resting-state. These activity modulate each subject's functional network in a
different way and to a different extent, and hence tamper the estimation of the
group's functional networks. Such subject-specific confounding factors are less
likely to be negligible by simple averaging compared to other sources of noise
such as scanner noise, subject motion and coregistration.

Second, group analysis are often conducted in a \emph{one way} procedure. In
some scenarios~\cite{van2008normalized,craddock2012whole,greicius2004default,
  greicius2007resting,seeley2009neurodegenerative,mohammadi2009changes}, each
subject's functional network is estimated independently, and a group map is
simply summarized by averaging the subjects' connectivity maps. The estimates of
subject maps by these procedures do not use other subjects' information and are
robust to noise. The group summary map extracted from these subject maps is
hence sub-optimal. In other scenarios~\cite{calhoun2001method}, a group map is
estimated first from the concatenated data, then is back-reconstructed to obtain
the subject network maps. More recently, the subject network maps are estimated
from the averaged group map using a dual regression
approach~\cite{filippini2009distinct,beckmann2009group}. Such methods treat
voxel intensity from all subjects the same way for group map estimation,
ignoring that they may have subject specific variances. Both class of approaches
do not iteratively refine the initial group or subject estimates, and the
estimation of one subject's connectivity does not benefit from the information
obtained from other subjects. Figure \ref{fig:bidirections} gives an
illustration of the various methods and their order of estimations.

\end{figure}

Last, spatial smoothing is often used during preprocessing in order to address
the issue of imperfect inter-subject alignment. While spatially blurring the
time series increases the signal-to-noise ratio, the choice of the smoothing
kernel size has a big impact on the estimated functional maps. Over-smoothing
inevitably results in the loss of fine structures of the functional maps. In
practice, the random field theory of statistical parametric mapping (SPM)
\cite{friston2007statistical} requires the smoothing kernel even larger than the
anticipated region of interest. One need a model that uses the spatial
dependency and the inter-subject similarity of the rs-fMRI signals, without
losing the finer details of the functional patterns.

A data-driven, unified probabilistic framework will help solving the above
issues. The model should integrate both group's and subjects' connectivity
variables into this model. One can make inference from the posterior
distribution of the variables in both subject and group levels given the
observed BOLD signal.

This thesis presents a series of statistical methods for identification of the
functional networks by using the rs-fMRI data. All the methods aim to model the
spatial dependency within a single subject in a principal way without the naive
spatial smoothing, and model the inter-subject similarity and variations for a
more accurate group and subject network estimation. The main mathematical tools
are Markov random fields (MRF), graphical model and Bayesian method, and I use
various methods including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and
variational inference for solving the statistical inference problem in the high
dimensional space.

%% \section{Problem Statement}
%% The analysis of rs-fMRI data is a challenging task, due to the scanner noise,
%% physiological noise, head motion, and subject's random thoughts during data
%% acquisition. Various techniques are proposed to address these issue. Among them,
%% (1) spatial smoothing is used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and (2)
%% group analysis is used to increase the statistical power by estimating an
%% average functional network and to allow comparisons between groups. Both
%% approaches have drawbacks that are to be elaborated in the next two paragraphs.
%% In my work I address the issues concerning the above two aspects, with the focus
%% on the latter.

%% In conventional functional connectivity studies, the spatial regularities of the
%% connectivity are enforced by applying a smoothing filter as a preprocessing
%% step. Depending on the noise level and the number of subjects in a group study,
%% optimal kernel width of the filter may vary~\cite{mikl2008effects}. In current
%% state-of-art processing pipeline, the kernel size is arbitrarily given a value
%% ranging from 4mm to 10mm. This may introduce over-smoothing and pose difficulty
%% in identifying connections between small regions, or introduce under-smoothing
%% resulting in insufficient noise reduction. Moreover, the sub-optimal choice of
%% the smoothing parameters can change the result drastically. There needs to be a
%% statistical method that explicitly models the spatial smoothness of the
%% connectivity patterns. The model should be data-driven in that the parameters
%% are estimated from the fMRI images data under study.

%% In the group analysis, subjects may exhibit similar but not exactly same
%% spontaneous BOLD fluctuation. Current group studies typically first identify
%% each subject's connectivity separately regardless of other subjects, and then
%% estimate a \emph{pooled} summary of the group connectivity
%% map~\cite{van2008normalized,craddock2011whole}, or estimate group map first and
%% then back-reconstruct the subject network map~\cite{calhoun2001method}.  Such
%% approaches are sub-optimal, since estimation of one subject's connectivity does
%% not benefit from other subjects. From a Bayesian  point of view, once
%% the population distribution is known, it can help each subject's estimation as a
%% prior. Subjects network estimates also gives feedback on group estimation.  We
%% need a data-driven, unified probabilistic framework and put the connectivity
%% variables of both group and subjects jointly into this model. Inference can be
%% made from the posterior of the variables in both (subject and group) levels
%% given the observed time series data.

%% Furthermore, the full Bayesian model provides us an opportunity to study the
%% variability of the functional network by inference of the posterior. Besides the
%% traditional variance and confidence interval analysis, the mode of spatial
%% variability can be inferred from multivariate analysis. For the first time, to
%% our best knowledge, it would be possible to visualize how functional homogeneous
%% regions change along the principal direction of their posterior variability, and
%% compare these change across subjects.

\section{Thesis Statement}
Here is the statement of this thesis:
\begin{center}
\parbox{5in}{\emph{A multilevel Markov Random Field model improves the
    reliability of the functional network estimation in rs-fMRI group study by
    taking into account context information as a prior. The data-driven Bayesian
    model can jointly estimate both population and subjects' connectivity
    networks, as well as drawing inference on the uncertainty in the estimation,
    and on the variability across subjects. }}
\end{center}

\noindent The phrase \emph{Context} has two meanings: 1) The functional patterns
of human brain is spatially coherent. Neighboring voxels have larger probability
of being in the same functional network. 2) The network that a voxel belongs to
in one subjects is dependant on the networks of the same voxels in other
subjects. The patterns of functional networks from the rs-fMRI study are to some
extent shared by multiple subjects, while the variability across subjects must
be taken into account.

By \emph{reliability} I mean the decrease in the variance of the functional
networks that we estimate with different subsets of all subjects. The reliable
estimates will be closer to the true network in simulation test, where we know
the true answer.

To test our statement, we propose the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Full Pairwise Connectivity With Spatial Coherence.} I propose a
    method that estimates pairwise functional connectivity in the whole brain of
    a single subject, without \emph{a priori} knowledge of the seed region. The
    model needs to take into account the spatial context information, and learn
    the strength of the coherence from the data.

  \item \textbf{Identify Consistent, Spatially Coherent Multiple Functional
    Networks.} I propose a data-driven, generative model that can cluster the
    gray matter voxels of single subject's brain into disjoint multiple
    functional networks, while respecting the spatial coherence of the voxels.

  \item \textbf{Hierarchical Model For Group Study.} I propose a hierarchical
    model that can estimate functional networks from a group of subjects. The
    model will estimate an overall group's network map as well as individual
    subjects network maps at the same time. When Clustering the voxels into
    different networks, spatial neighbors both within and across subjects will
    be used in a prior of a Bayesian framework. The variability of each
    subject's connectivity due to noise and artifact will be reduced to the
    extent that is to be determined automatically from the data.

  \item \textbf{Variability of Resting-State Functional Network. } Based on the
    hierarchical MRF model proposed above, I will draw inference on the variance
    and the confidence intervals of the functional network. I will test the
    variability of the network by using a subset of the data and perform
    bootstrap sampling. I also plan to explore and visualize the modes of
    spatial variability of the functional network patterns.
\end{itemize}

\section{Outline and Contributions}
The remainder of the thesis is organized in the following chapters. 

In chapter \ref{chap:bg}, I will give a survey of the methods of modeling the
brain's functional connectivities using rs-fMRI, as well as the statistical
inference methods.

Chapter \ref{chap:math} gives a general introduction of the mathematical tools
that will be used in the following chapters. The tools includes the definition
of the graph, graphical models, sampling methods and variational methods for
solving the problem on the graph.

Chapter \ref{chap:method1} will discover the first method than estimate a single
subject's functional system. This chapter is an application of the graphical
model and Markov random field that we introduce in chapter \ref{chap:math}. In
this particular case, the MRF is in a high dimensional space. And we use
variational inference to solve the problem. The inference is implemented on
graphical processing unit (GPU) to speed up such a problem with $N^2$
complexity.

Chapter \ref{chap:method2} applies the graphical model in a different
settings. Here the model is defined on the voxels in original image domain
instead of on a higher dimensional domain in previous chapter. Together with a
mixture model and Bayesian method, we estimate all functional systems of a
single subject dataset with spatial regularization.

Chapter 6 extends the concept of the graph to multiple subjects, and aims a
multi-level analysis with a group of rs-fMRI data. Both group and subject
functional networks are estimated with higher accuracy than standard
methods. This chapter will also cover the validation of the hierarchical model
Besides the estimation accuracy, we focus on the consistency of the method
across multiple sessions, and also under data perturbation.

Chapter 7 concludes the thesis with a general discussion, and also the future
work.
