In this thesis I study the functional connectivity of the human brain by the
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The functional
MRI measures the change of exygen consumption level in the blood vessel, hence
indirectly detects the brain's neuro activity. When there is no external
stimuli, one use rs-fMRI to detect the brain's spontaneous activity. To study
the intrinsic brain activity is an important step to explore human brain's
functional organization and dynamics, and to understand the difference of the
functional patterns of normal people and patients with mental disorder, such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorders.
