-- add clinical motivation in chap 1.

-- check the weiliu/research to see if I can add anything. 

-- lesion segmentation as a preprocessing step of fMRI analysis.

-- talk about the similarity criteria. ICC rand index etc.

-- Discuss why it is not feasible to define a group distribution on top of
   subject distribution and still have MRF on the group.  Dirichlet
   distribution.

-- in 6dmrf model, the there are 2 modes in the mixture, which is similar to the
   mixture model used for task based data.

-- add Woolrich "mixture models with adaptive spatial regularization...." to the
   related work chapter, MRF section.

-- if you have time, add the Wood's vMF simulation method into the method2 as a
   appendix.

%% The study of the brain's intrinsic activity with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)
%% data is usually carried on a group of subjects. Combining data from multiple
%% subjects mitigates the effects of the scanner and physiological noise, head
%% motion artifacts, and confounds of subject specific spontaneous activity during
%% data acquisition. The typical goal of a group study is to estimate a robust
%% network common to the group.


%% here is no explicit statistical modeling of the variability between the group
%% and subject component maps.  Ng et. al \cite{nggroup2012} use group
%% replicator dynamics to detect subject's sparse component maps, with group
%% information integrated into each subject's RD process.

%% Because the group level clustering is conducted after subject level clustering,
%% the clustering of one subject is unaware of the information from other subjects,
%% as well as the group clustering.

% backup: The group label acts as an agent among the subjects, thus bridging an
% implicit dependencies between subjects functional networks.
