First of all I would like to express my honest gratitude to my advisor Tom
Fletcher for his gide through my Ph.D. study. I was lucky to join Tom's
group in 2008. We decide to start a venturing research direction, functional MRI
study, which no one in the SCI institute has experience on, and the number of
research in Utah on fMRI probably can be counted by one hand. Tom's patience is
the key factor that I had a smooth learning curve in the multidisciplinary field
of neuroscience, brain anatomy, statistics and computing. More importantly, Tom
taught me the scientific methods of making observation, forming hypothesis,
performing experiments and analyzing results. Such scientific thinking will be
my life-long assets. I am particularly indebted to Tom's numerous reminding me
to focus on the main theme of research, for I am often distracted by some
interesting but tangential research fields. From him I learned to concentrate on
one problem in order to achieve a successful Ph.D.

I would like give thanks also to Jeff Anderson, who's insight on fMRI study
