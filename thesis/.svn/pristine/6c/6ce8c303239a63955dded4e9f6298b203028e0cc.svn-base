Human brain is organized into distributed functional modeules that work
independently for some cognitive tasks but also interact with each other. There
appears two principles of functional organization: functional integration and
functional specialization\cite{friston2007statistical}. The functional
specialization assumes the module that process a particular cognitive activity
can be localized to a anatomical region in the brain, and study the relationship
of the anatomical regions and the particular cognitive activity. However, the
regions, or functional modules do not work alone. There is interactions among
the functional modules. Functional integration study such interactions.

This chapter provide background information of the current research of exploring
brain's functional network using rs-fMRI. I will begin with the relationshiop
between brain activity and fMRI, and give the definitions of functional
connectivity and functional network. Then I will survey various class of methods
that estimate the functional connectivity and the networks. Last some general
graphical model concepts and inference method will be given. these mathematical
tools will be used in the following chapters, with changes depending on the
specific applications.

% the interaction: anatomical connectivity and functional connectivity. 
The interaction between various brain's functional modules can be represented by
the connectivity between anatomical regions. Two sets of MRI techniques are
widely used for mapping the \emph{in vivo} human's brain connectivity. Diffusion
MRI, or more specifically, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to find the
anatomical links between any two regions in the brain's white matter, and
functional MRI (fMRI) is used to identify the functional links between two
regions of interest in brain's gray matter. Researchers have shown the
correlation between the anatomical and functional connections although they are
not exactly same. This work is mainly focused on the functional connectivity.

% fmri intro, BOLD, oxygen, task-based. 
The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal of fMRI detects the
locations of increased neuro activity by measuring the blood oxygen levels at
consecutive time points. the oxygen consumption in the blood indicates the
corresponding regions consume more energy, and hence in a more active neural
activity compared to baseline activity. Therefore the BOLD signal is an indirect
way of identifying neural activities. 

% various methods to map brain functions.
Besides fMRI, other techniques are also used for mapping brain's functions. The
differ in terms of both their temporal and spatial resolution. In general,
electrophysiological methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or the
associated magnetic version magnetoencephalography (MEG) record the neural
events in real time, hence have relatively high temporal resolution. On the
other hand, fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET) detect the change of
blood flow due to neuronal information processing, and have high spatial
resolution (1-6 mm) but lower temporal resolution, because of the delayed
haemodynamic changes.

% func connectivity. 
fMRI is initially discovered as a tool to map the brain's function for subjects
under specific cognitive task. One compares the BOLD signal at a specific region
in the brain with the paradigm task signal. Because of the nature of the
haemodynamics of the blood, the paradigm task signal is the convolution of the
original paradigm function (for example a boxcar function) with the haemodynamic
response function (HRF). Later, people found that the BOLD signals not only can
be used to compare between one brain region and the paradigm signal, but also to
compare between any two brain regions. Such pairwise comparisons are used to
explore the interactions between various functional modules of the
brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependence of neuronal
activity patterns of spatially remote (or anatomically separated) brain regions
(Friston, 1993). The temporal dependence is measured by the linear correlation
across all time points. Although the temporal correlation within the BOLD signal
of single region or voxel violate the independence assumption of the time point
samples, this temporal correlation is often safely ignored. Alternatively, one
also identify functional connectivity by transforming the signals into frequency
domain and compute the coherence of two signals at curtain frequency band. This
is equivalent to band pass filtering the original BOLD signal and compute the
linear correlation.

\section{Related Work}
[Seed-based correlation, ICA, clustering, etc]

% Define a functional network. 
The pairwise correlation or coherence only measure the functional connectivity
between regions as a local measurement. As the whole brain is organized as a
complex system with many such pairwise interactions, it is of interests to find
out those regions with similar patterns of neuronal activity. A functional
network, or functional system (hereafter used interchangeably), is a collection
of separate anatomical regions that have similar patterns of activity measured
by BOLD signal. The regions within a functional system may have direct or
indirect information flow among them. Together the system serve one or more
cognitive tasks. An anatomical region may participate in different functional
system under different cognitive tasks.

%% [ Various levels. Task, resting, Cognitive disease. Mental disorder. Low
%% frequency. Correlation.
The correlated fluctuations of multiple brain regions not only happens in a
stimulus-evoked experiments, but also in experiments where the participants
rested passively without any cognition activity. Therefore, the resting-state
fMRI (rs-fMRI) becomes a powerful tool for probing functional network patterns
in a resting-brain. The original name of the rs-fMRI is not accurate, since the
brain are not in a true resting state even without any cognitive activity. The
resting-brain consume about 20 percent of the whole body's energy, while it only
have about 5 percent of the body mass. The study of the functional system of
brain under rest will help understanding the functional organization of the
brain. Because the pathologic conditions appear to be reflected to the
interactions within or between the functional system, the rs-fMRI study also
holds valuable diagnostic and prognostic information towards various
neurological or psychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's disease, depression,
schizophrenia, etc~\cite{fox2007spontaneous}. The reason of this spontaneous
activity is largely unknown, although some reasonably postulate that it is a
predictive intrinsic response to the unknown events in the outside environment.


%% [How to define a functional network or system. Seed based. ICA, clustering. ROI
%% or voxel-based.]
\subsection{Seed Based methods}
There are various ways of representations of functional networks depending on
the specific experiment goal. A straightforward yet statistically powerful
method is to compute the correlation between \emph{a priori} given seed regions
and every other regions in the brain. The correlation values are typically the
Fisher transformation in order to meet the normal distribution assumption in the
following hypothesis test. Those transformed correlation values with p value
smaller than certain threshold are regarded as a indicator of the existence of
the functional connectivity. All voxels or regions that are functional connected
to the seed regions belong to the same functional system. The advantage of
seed-based methods is its simplicity and relatively ease of extending to
multiple subjects. One just compute the average correlations across subjects for
a given pair of regions. However, it also has the limits that the user has to
know in advance the seed. Therefore, a functional system can not identified if
it does not include the specified seed regions. Despite the limits, it is used
in may works, sometimes with better visualization by dynamic moving the seed and
show the real-time functional system associated with the current seed region.

\subsection{ICA}
Because of functional networks are in a large scale over the whole brain, and in
a distributed manner, multi-variate analysis would help. A large class of
multi-variate methods use the signal-decomposition concept in the signal
processing community, and decompose the BOLD signal at certain regions into
various independent components, each of which as part of one functional
system. The percentage or weights of these components will represent whether or
to what extent the region belong to certain networks. One widely accepted method
in this class is the independent component analysis (ICA). ICA was originally
introduced in signal processing field to separate varisou source of signals from
samples of mixed signals. The central limit theorem states the sum of two
independent signals is more Gaussian then any of the original signals. Therefore
maximizing the non-Gaussianity gives us the original independent
components. Besides the maximization of non-Gaussianity, the independent can also
be estimated by minimization of mutual information, or by maximum
likelihood\cite{hyvarinen2000independent}.

There are two varieties when applying to ICA to rs-fMRI dataset. Spatial ICA
assume all the voxel intensity at certain time point as one mixed signal
sample. Therefore the mixed signals are independent across all spatial
voxels. Alternatively, temporal ICA each BOLD time series at a voxel is a mixed
signal, hence the source signals are independent across the time
point\cite{calhoun2001spatial}. Because of the large number of voxels compared
to number of time points, the spatial ICA is typically used for rs-fMRI
analysis. Compared to seed-based methods, ICA is purely data-driven. However,
because ICA need to estimate both the independent components and mixing
coefficients, it is a significantly more difficult task. By A whitening step
before ICA, the data is rotated such that it has unit variance in terms of the
covariance matrix, and greatly simplify the ICA problem. The estimated
independent components are usually z transformed, and thresholded for
visualization purpose. Because the resting-state brain functional patterns are
unpredictable, the output independent components need to be visually inspected
in order to identify physiologically meaningful components.

\subsection{Group Analysis}
%% [Group of subjects. Variation and shared information. resting-state intrinsic
%% cognition. 1000 connectomes. ]
The analysis fMRI data is challenging, due to the scanner noise, physiological
noise such as blood vessel and heart beat, subject's head motion. Sometimes
subjects have random thoughts even instructed not thinking anything specifically
during the data acquisition. The functional connectivity and network estimation
is still not accurate and consistent even various preprocessing techniques are
used. On the other hand, because rs-fMRI experiments have much lower requirement
to the patient subjects or control subjects compared to a paradigm design
experiments, it is possible to collect the rs-fMRI data from a big group of
subjects. the functional networks detected by either model-based methods such as
seed-based correlation, or data-driven methods such as ICA, are highly
reproducible across participants and scans. The more accurate and consistent
functional networks can be estimated by using the statistical power of the group
analysis. With the initiative of 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, large
cohort of data are available for researchers to explore the relationship of
functional networks to the subjects age, gender etc.

% seed-based methods extend to grp analysis.
Compared with single-subject analysis, the methods for multiple-subject
functinal network analysis are not yet established. The seed-based methods
typically compute the correlation or regression coefficients between regions
independently for each subject. The correlations or regression coefficients are
treated as a statistics of each subjects, and go into a second level
analysis. The second level can be either fixed-effect analysis, or a
random-effect analysis with a standard hypothesis testing. The population-based
z-score maps have to be corrected for multiple comparisons\cite{fox2005human}.

% group ICA
Group ICA is used as an extension of single-subject ICA in order to seek a set
of independent components shared across multiple
subjects~\cite{calhoun2001spatial}. In a typical group ICA study, all subjects
are registered to a common atlas and assumed to share a common spatial component
map but have distinct time courses. The BOLD signals from all subjects are
concatenated temporally, followed by a single subject ICA. The subject component
maps are then obtained by a back-reconstruction procedure. Alternatively,
single-subject ICA is applied on each subject first, and a self-organized
clustering algorithm applies to all subjects' components such that similar
components are assigned into one cluster. The group ICA components are
represented by the centers of the
clusters~\cite{esposito2005independent}. Neither of the above approaches
iteratively refine group (or subject) maps once the subjects (or group) maps are
estimated.

% assumption of the group study.
the group study also pose new chanllenges when putting all datasets
together. First the inter-subject registration is often not accurate enough to
map same anatomical structures to same coordinates in standard space. This may
be due to the imperfect co-registration algorithm itself, and also due to the
difference of individual subjects cortical structures. Even the anatomical
structures are aligned among multiple subjects, the functional patterns of each
subject are not exactly same.
