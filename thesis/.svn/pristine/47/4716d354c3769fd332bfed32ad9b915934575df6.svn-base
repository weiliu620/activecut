-- add clinical motivation in chap 1.

-- citations. (books)

-- lesion segmentation as a preprocessing step of fMRI analysis.

-- talk about the similarity criteria. ICC rand index etc.

-- Discuss why it is not feasible to define a group distribution on top of subject distribution and still have MRF on the group.  Dirichlet distribution. 

-- in 6dmrf model, the there are 2 modes in the mixture, which is similar to the mixture model used for task based data. 

-- add Woolrich "mixture models with adaptive spatial regularization...." to the related work chapter, MRF section. 

-- review reference and look for typos. 
-- if you have time, add the Wood's vMF simulation method into the method2 as a appendix.
