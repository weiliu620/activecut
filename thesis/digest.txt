% func connectivity does not directly meature aantomic connectivity, but it is

% func connectivity can also be used to infer anatomical connectivities, since
  the latter can not be on living human. also talk about DTI.

See woodriche "multilevel linear modelling...". For task-based analysis,
hierarchical model can be used. However, the hierarchy of rs-fMRI study remains
unclear.


The clique potential is a non-negative function defined on the r.v.'s in the
clique.

notes: need to give a long intro of SPM and spatial smoothing in the background
chapter.
