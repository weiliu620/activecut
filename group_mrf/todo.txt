- when save nii file, also save png file, for 2d image.

- Rejection rate of Metropolis. (low)
- add a argument to golden-section function, for the relative error.
-- add a prior to parameters.
-- what will happen if a cluster does not get any point?

*************** Group MRF ******************************
-- Make a commen mask from individual sub's mask by 'or' operation. And use a threshold on that.


*************** Group MRF ******************************
-- Add estimate kappa with prior section to document.
-- Use more subjects on Kmean and see what the result looks like.
-- Each subject's sample need to save to the same filename, so I know which sub it is from. Now there is no good way to do this. 
-- Try to decrease alpha so group lable has less effect on subject level.

When run this command:
run -f ~/dataset/groupfmri -m cleanmask.nii -i grouplabelmap.nii -v 2 --alpha 1 --betaz 0.01 --betag 0.01 -b 3 -n 3

I get 0.4 at (7,23,10) from groupprobmap.nii, while original grouplabelmap does not have this voxel.



done:
-- no burn-in for ICM, use convergence(stop) criteria.
-- Find a profiler tool for running time of each function.
-- how about graph-cuts in E step?
- Compare with ICM for percentage of correct classification, parameters, etc. (high)
-- An annealing procedure?
- Make sure random generator should be initialized once, and initialized with a fixed value for debugging. (high)
- Compute 2nd derivative and use Newton-Raphson method for estimating beta. Check the condition, and if 2nd derivative is negative, go back to gradient descent. (high)
- One step Newton method in estimating beta at M step. (low)

- Use 4 labels instead of 5. (high)
- At end of EM, we know the parameters, and can just choose a label that maximize P(f | d). That is icm. 
- numScan and burnin should be parameters of segimage.
- Sort the labels so small labels have small mean.
- Init sigma with a more data-driven value.
-- when joint likelihood begins decreasing, it's time to increase mc samples.
- Estimate beta on true label image. (low).
- Save estimated parameter (beta, mu and sigma) in each EM iteration into a file, for visualization. 
- Split the creat true image and emission process.
-- ICM on nChain after M step.
-- At end of EM, run ICM on each n Chain. Pick the one with max joint likelihood. 

-- Use vector container for mu and sigma. (high)
-- Change MCModel::print() to better name. (low)
-- my own prog to mask image.
-- icmEstep naychange > a number.

-- The conditional log likelihood is positive number, which is weird.
-- Bessel function when computing normalization constant.
