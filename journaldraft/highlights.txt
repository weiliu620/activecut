Highlights:

A hierarchical method for estimating intrinsic functional networks from a group.

Jointly estimate group and subjects in a single graphical model.

Data-driven with Bayesian framework and parameter estimation. 

Higher accuracy, consistency, and more robustness in synthetic and real data.
